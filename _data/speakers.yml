    description: >
      Michael Macy is Distinguished Professor of Arts and Sciences at Cornell and Director of the Social Dynamics Lab.
      With support from the U.S. National Science Foundation, Google, Yahoo! Research, DARPA, IARPA, and the Korean National Research Foundation,
      his research team has used computational models, online laboratory experiments, and digital traces of device-mediated interaction
      to explore enigmatic social patterns, including network “wormholes,” diurnal rhythms, racial discrimination on Airbnb, lifestyle politics,
      the polarization of science, network mobility, and partisan unpredictability.

  - name: Linda Douw
    title: "Multiscale Network Neuroscience:"
    subtitle: "Connecting cells to circuits to networks in brain tumor patients"
    affiliation: "Associate Professor, Amsterdam UMC & Head of the Multiscale Network Neuroscience Lab"
    description: >
      Linda Douw discovered network neuroscience during the final phase of her Master in Clinical Neuropsychology in Amsterdam. 
      She continued to do a PhD on "Neural networks and brain tumors: the interplay between tumor, cognition, and epilepsy" at VU University Medical Center, which she finished in 2010.
      She then moved to Boston (US) for a postdoc at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging (MGH/MIT/Harvard Medical School), 
      further investigating multimodal network approaches to better understand brain tumors and epilepsy. 
      In 2014, she moved back to Amsterdam to start her own lab, now called "Multiscale Network Neuroscience".
      She is currently an associate professor in the department of Anatomy and Neurosciences of the Amsterdam UMC, 
      and leads a multidisciplinary research team. More information on the team's work can be found on www.multinetlab.com.

  - name: Iza Romanowska
    title: "Can the Past Save Our Future?"
    subtitle: ""
    affiliation: ""
    description: >
      Iza Romanowska is a complexity scientist working at the intersection of computational and social sciences. 
      Together with the team at the Social Resilience Lab, she applies computational methods to explore why some communities thrived for millennia 
      while others succumbed to the first major crisis. Her expertise lies in agent-based modelling, a simulation technique used to understand the 
      dynamics of ancient and modern socio-environmental systems. A graduate of the Institute for Complex System Simulation at the University of Southampton, 
      she previously led the Social Science Simulation and Digital Humanities Research Group at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center before moving up north 
      to Aarhus University, Denmark. Currently, she splits her time between the ERC project The Model City. Drivers and Mechanism of Urban Resilience and 
      training the next generation of agent-based modellers in historical sciences.
