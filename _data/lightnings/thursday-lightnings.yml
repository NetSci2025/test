    Talk title: Impact of directionality on the emergence of Turing patterns on m-directed
      higher-order structures
    Abstract: 'Turing patterns, hallmarks of self-organized processes, emerge when
      ordered structures arise from initial disorder due to the complex nonlinear
      interactions between the elements of a system. Initially studied in continuous
      settings, these patterns have recently been explored on networks, where nodes
      represent spatial regions hosting local reactions between two chemical species,
      the activator and the inhibitor, while edges model the diffusion process. This
      approach has made it possible to study Turing instability on graphs, but also
      on undirected hypergraphs. In this work, we develop a theory of Turing instability
      on m-directed hypergraphs. These structures generalize hypergraphs by dividing
      the nodes of a hyperedge into two disjoint sets: tail nodes and head nodes.
      This directionality introduces a privileged mechanism in which the collective
      action of tail nodes drives the reactions involving head nodes. This generalization
      thus provides an extended framework compared to traditional directed networks.
      Using linear stability analysis, we demonstrate that the directionality of m-directed
      hypergraphs promotes Turing instability, enabling the emergence of stationary
      or wave-like patterns within parameter regimes inaccessible to symmetric configurations.
      We also derive two specific Laplace matrices that allow for a rigorous analytical
      characterization of these patterns. The theoretical findings are validated through
      simulations using the Brusselator model, applied to a directed m-hyperring and
      a directed random hypergraph. Our work highlights the crucial role of directionality
      in the emergence of Turing patterns and broadens the traditional frameworks
      of network theory.'

    Talk title: 'Phase Transition in Particles Aggregates: an Application to Biofilm
      Formation'
    Abstract: In this work, we developed a high-performance individual-based simulation
      to investigate biofilm formation driven by mutualistic interactions. Our results
      reveal that the system undergoes a sharp phase transition from a planktonic
      state to a biofilm state as the ratio of mutualistic to competitive interactions
      increases. Furthermore, we find that the critical point of this transition depends
      on the specific topology of the interaction network. Using mathematical arguments,
      we explain this transition as being driven by nucleation processes, characterized
      by the formation of bacterial clusters of critical size that, once established,
      can only grow and not be dismantled. This work not only provides a compelling
      hypothesis that biofilm formation is driven by nucleation processes but also
      introduces a versatile model capable of generating sharp phase transitions,
      with broad applicability.

    Talk title: Spectral Graph Pruning Against Over-Squashing and Over-Smoothing
    Abstract: 'Message Passing Graph Neural Networks are known to suffer from two
      problems that are sometimes believed to be diametrically opposed: over-squashing
      and over-smoothing. The former results from topological bottlenecks that hamper
      the information flow from distant nodes and are mitigated by spectral gap maximization,
      primarily, by means of edge additions. However, such additions often promote
      over-smoothing that renders nodes of different classes less distinguishable.
      Inspired by the Braess phenomenon, we argue that deleting edges can address
      over-squashing and over-smoothing simultaneously. This insight explains how
      edge deletions can improve generalization, thus connecting spectral gap optimization
      to a seemingly disconnected objective of reducing computational resources by
      pruning graphs for lottery tickets. To this end, we propose a computationally
      effective spectral gap optimization framework to add or delete edges and demonstrate
      its effectiveness on the long range graph benchmark and on larger heterophilous
      datasets.'

    Talk title: 'Modeling diffusion in networks with communities: a multitype branching
      process approach'
    Abstract: 'The dynamics of diffusion in complex networks are widely studied to
      understand how entities, such as information, diseases, or behaviors, spread
      in an interconnected environment. Complex networks often present community structure,
      and tools to analyze diffusion processes on networks with communities are needed.
      In this paper, we develop theoretical tools using multi-type branching processes
      to model and analyze diffusion processes, following a simple contagion mechanism,
      across a broad class of networks with community structure. We show how, by using
      limited information about the network --- the degree distribution within and
      between communities --- we can calculate standard statistical characteristics
      of propagation dynamics, such as the extinction probability, hazard function,
      and cascade size distribution. These properties can be estimated not only for
      the entire network but also for each community separately. Furthermore, we estimate
      the probability of spread crossing from one community to another where it is
      not currently spreading. We demonstrate the accuracy of our framework by applying
      it to two specific examples: the Stochastic Block Model and a log-normal network
      with community structure. We show how the initial seeding location affects the
      observed cascade size distribution on a heavy-tailed network and that our framework
      accurately captures this effect.'

    Talk title: Distinguishing isomorphic graphs with persistent homology on a chordless
      cycles filtration
    Abstract: Persistent homology, a technique from computational topology, has recently
      gained attention in graph machine learning. Previous work bridges the gap between
      computational topology and graph machine learning, by analyzing persistent homology
      expressivity for graph learning tasks. However, they do not provide theoretical
      foundations in the choice of graph filtration methods in terms of their expressivity
      as in the k-FWL test. On the other hand, it has been recently shown that a proper
      graph weighting method based on chordless cycles can help identify the latent
      dimension of networks. In this work, we propose a new class of filtrations in
      persistent homology based on the density of edge triangles, squares, and pentagons
      and its application in graph learning. After choosing a filtration, we expand
      the graph by filling in all (k + 1)-cliques with filtration values and calculating
      persistent homology up to dimension k. Our persistent homology calculations
      result in a set of persistence diagrams for each graph, which we compare in
      a pairwise manner using the bottleneck distance, to decide if two graphs are
      different. We address the graph isomorphism problem, aiming to distinguish graphs
      from various datasets like BREC, strongly regular graphs (SSR), minimal Cayley
      graphs, or cubic graphs. Our proposed filtration outperforms curvature- or Laplacian-based
      filtration in the BREC dataset for k = 1 and k = 2. Moreover, for SSRs for k
      = 1 only our filtration can distinguish non-isomorphic graphs. We also study
      how expressive different filtrations are by comparing them to the k-FWL test.
      Our results demonstrate the strength of density-based filtrations in distinguishing
      non-isomorphic graphs, particularly in challenging datasets. Besides graph learning
      tasks, our method could find applications in chemistry or biology. For example,
      in molecular graphs. Density-based filtrations could capture structural variations,
      complementing existing geometric and chemical approaches.

    Talk title: Association between oral microbiota and close-range proximity of children
      in primary school
    Abstract: The human microbiota is a complex ecosystem of microorganisms inhabiting
      the human body and it influences human health and well-being. Recent studies
      showed its interplay with social behavior, suggesting that part of the microbiota
      might be socially transmissible [1, 2]. One of the main challenges encountered
      in these studies is accurately measuring the network of social interactions,
      typically estimated from known, long-standing relations. While information on
      these associations is readily available, using such relationships does not allow
      the study of the microbiota’s similarities among individuals with social contacts
      reaching beyond their closest social circle. We investigate the association
      between social interactions and oral microbiota composition in 35 primary school
      children. This cohort comprises individuals from different families, allowing
      us to consider interactions beyond the familiar social circle. We characterized
      the participants’ oral microbiota with saliva sampling during class hours and
      16S rRNA gene sequencing. In parallel, we objectively measured a close-range
      proximity network among children with wearable sensors, developed by the SocioPatterns
      collaboration [3]. The results summarized in Figure 1 show that prolonged interactions
      are associated with a significantly higher microbiota similarity. We identify
      a set of 19 taxa whose distribution across children better correlates with the
      structure of the proximity network and finally show that the most central children
      in the proximity network have a higher number of these taxa in their microbiota.  In
      conclusion, our study shows a strong association between oral microbiota and
      close-range proximity of non-cohabiting children in a primary school setting,
      complementing the results on cohabiting individuals. This suggests that microbiota
      might be transmitted in social settings, and it motivates further research on
      the interplay between the social network structure and the microbiota composition.

    Talk title: Exact probability of a link between two nodes in an Erdős-Rényi random
      graph given their degrees
    Abstract: The probability of a link between two nodes is commonly said to be $d_i
      d_j / (2L-1)$, but this is demonstrably false since it is based on an approximation.
      This probability appears in the formula of Newman’s modularity, which plays
      a crucial rule in detecting community structures in networks. We derive an exact
      analytic form for the probability in simple graphs and show that correcting
      Newman’s modularity formula with our exact probability can lead to different
      communities being detected.

    Talk title: 'Legal Networks: An Invitation'
    Abstract: 'Social networks, ecological networks, technological networks, financial
      networks, cultural and historical networks, linguistic networks, ...: Among
      the many applied domains listed in the call for abstracts at NetSci 2025, legal
      networks are a notable absence. In this work, we review how network methods
      have been used in the legal domain, clarify how legal networks differ from social
      networks and other domain-specific networks, and introduce our conceptual framework
      for studying networks in law – laying the foundation for our living survey of
      legal network science. Building on our extensive prior research, we highlight
      what challenges researchers face in modeling and measuring legal networks, and
      we discuss how joint efforts to tackle these challenges can inspire methodological
      innovation in the broader network-science community. In legal systems, individuals
      and institutions that operate in different branches of the public or the private
      sector, at different levels of the legal hierarchy (above, on, or below the
      national level), continuously create, modify, and interpret legal texts in response
      to system-internal and system-external stimuli – "the law" emerges from these
      myriad interactions. As such, legal systems are naturally higher-order, multilayer,
      temporal, adaptive, and intricately coupled with other systems (e.g., social,
      ecological, and technological systems), combining features from multiple advanced
      network models. By demonstrating how legal networks are distinct from, yet closely
      connected to, other topics of interest to network scientists, we hope to draw
      more researchers into this exciting field – and to help bring together those
      already active in the area. Thus, we also argue the case for including legal
      networks in future NetSci calls as a separate category.'

    Talk title: The Temporal Event Graph as a Tool for Modelling Spreading Processes
    Abstract: Understanding how an epidemic spreads through a network is crucial for
      devising effective mitigation strategies. While there exists a large body of
      literature concerning the spread of epidemics on static networks, our understanding
      of how the dynamics of epidemic spreading interact with the temporal properties
      of a network is limited. Although, temporal characteristics, such as burstiness
      or causal temporal motifs, have been shown to fundamentally alter the spread
      of an epidemic, an accessible method of analysing such phenomena is missing.
      One promising approach to tackle this problem has been presented through mapping
      temporal networks to static graphs, which encode the relevant temporal information
      and unlock static network tools for the analysis of temporal networks. The temporal
      event graph representation takes this approach by mapping temporal events into
      nodes and connecting them via links directed forward in time, if they represent
      temporally adjacent event pairs. The result is a causal directed acyclic graph
      (DAG), which encodes all time-respecting paths in the network and allows for
      advantages computing the reachable sets of events. In a temporal network, an
      event - or node - can be reached from a source through time-respecting paths.
      The set of reachable nodes, or out-component, forms an upper bound for a spreading
      process. This representation maps into a reinforcing susceptible-infected-susceptible
      (rSIS) model evolving on the temporal structure, where each event will re-infect
      an already infected node, thus restarting its recovery clock. Importantly, this
      model appears as an upper bound approximation for a conventional SIS process.
      Our goal in this research is to explore this mapping and approximation to understand
      how we can use the event graph representation to study epidemic processes  without
      performing costly simulations.

    Talk title: Geometric separability of mesoscale patterns in embedding representation
      and visualization of multidimensional data and complex networks
    Abstract: A feature of complexity in connected systems is the emergence of mesoscale
      patterns in a geometric space, such as groupings in bird flocks. These patterns
      are formed by groups of points that tend to separate from each other, creating
      mesoscale structures. When multidimensional data or complex networks are embedded
      in a geometric space, some mesoscale patterns can appear respectively as clusters
      or communities, and their geometric separability is a feature according to which
      the performance of an algorithm for network embedding can be evaluated. Here,
      we introduce a framework for the definition and measure of the geometric separability
      (linear and nonlinear) of mesoscale patterns by solving the travelling salesman
      problem (TSP), and we offer experimental evidence on embedding and visualization
      of multidimensional data or complex networks, which are generated artificially
      or are derived from real complex systems. For the first time in literature the
      TSP’s solution is used to define a criterion of nonlinear separability of points
      in a geometric space, hence redefining the separability problem in terms of
      the travelling salesman problem is an innovation which impacts both computer
      science and complexity theory.

    Talk title: Temporal Graph Reproduction with RWIG
    Abstract: We examine the Random Walkers Induced temporal Graph (RWIG) model, which
      generates temporal graphs based on the co-location principle of $M$ independent
      walkers that traverse the underlying Markov graph with different transition
      probabilities. Given the assumption that each random walker is in the steady
      state, we determine the steady-state vector $\Tilde{s}$ and the Markov transition
      matrix $P_i$ of each walker $w_i$ that can reproduce the observed temporal network
      \(G_0,{...},G_{K{-}1}\) with the lowest mean squared error. We also show how
      to identify the number of states $N$ and the initial Markov graph of $M$ walkers
      from the $K$-length contact sequence of the random walkers. Finally, we examine
      the performance of RWIG for periodic temporal graph sequences.
