    Talk title: Network resuscitation – reviving failed networks
    Abstract: 'Complex systems often experience perturbations and disturbances, from
      overload failures in power systems to species extinction in ecological networks.
      The impact of such perturbations is often subtle, the system exhibits a minor
      response, but continues to sustain its global functionality. However, in extreme
      cases, a large enough perturbation may lead to a large-scale collapse, with
      the system abruptly transitioning from a functional to a dysfunctional dynamic
      state. For instance, in cellular dynamics, genetic knockouts, beyond a certain
      threshold, lead to cell death; in ecological systems, changes in environmental
      conditions may, in extreme cases, cause mass-extinction; and in infrastructure
      networks, a cascading failure, at times, results in a major blackout.  When
      such collapse occurs, the naïve instinct is to reverse the damage, retrieve
      the failed nodes and reconstruct the lost links. Such response however is seldom
      efficient, as (i) we rarely have access to all system components; (ii) even
      if we could reverse the damage, due to hysteresis, in many cases, the system
      will not spontaneously regain its lost functionality.  To address this challenge,
      we consider here a two-step recovery process: Step I. Restructuring. Retrieving
      the network topology to a point where the system can potentially regain functionality
      • Step II. Reigniting. Introducing dynamic interventions to steer the system
      back to its functional state.  The challenge in Step II is that we are typically
      limited in our potential interventions. Hence, we seek to reignite the system
      via micro-interventions, e.g., controlling just a single or, at most, few nodes.
      Therefore, in this talk, we present single-node reigniting, unveiling a new
      dynamic phase of complex systems, in which a failed system can be revived by
      controlling just a microscopic set of nodes. This helps jolt the network back
      to functionality – offering a practical network dynamics defibrillator.'

    Talk title: Fractional derivative in continuous-time Markov processes and applications
      to epidemics in networks
    Abstract: Since real-world epidemics are very likely characterized by non-exponential
      infections and curings, non-Markovian models are expected to describe real epidemic
      processes better. In order to account for memory in Markovian stochastic processes,
      we replace the standard differential operator in the Markovian equations with
      the well-known Caputo fractional derivative, an operator which generalizes the
      notion of standard derivative to non-integer orders (i.e., 0 < α < 1) and which
      incorporates memory effects “summing” over the past. We apply it to generalize
      the equations describing Markovian epidemic processes on networks and we prove
      that is possible to define a microscopic epidemic description that is compatible
      with the fractional framework.  Without making any assumption on the memory
      structure of the fractional process we obtain bounds for the average fraction
      of infected individuals (i.e., prevalence) and we show that for 0 < α < 1 the
      fractional epidemics is always worse (i.e. more dangerous) than the Markovian
      epidemics because grows faster in the beginning and survives more in the long-run.  Assuming
      that the fractional process satisfies the semi-Markov property, which means
      that the memory of the process is reset every time there is an update in the
      viral state of the network, we analytically prove that is possible to define
      a novel microscopic epidemic description that is compatible with the fractional
      Chapman-Kolmogorov equation. Finally we also show under which conditions any
      fractional stochastic process can be reduced to a corresponding Markov process
      via different kinds of time transformations, providing a practical tool to extend
      the well-known theory of Markovian epidemic process to a more general framework.

    Talk title: Interlocking path-dependencies in green industrial strategy networks
    Abstract: 'Green industrial strategy comprises policies that help steer a country''s
      economic structure towards sectors that are cleaner and produce green technologies.
      In both policy practice and the economic literature, green industrial strategy
      has been growing rapidly in popularity. In this study, we use network science
      methods to expose underlying patterns of industrial strategy that drive policy
      innovations. While network science is relatively novel to policy making, existing
      literature has stressed that policy making is a complex, evolving, path-dependent
      process. This paper is the first to study industrial strategy using network
      science and adds to a nascent literature on networks in policymaking.  We introduce
      a new dataset of green industrial strategy, spanning policies between 2008--2022
      that target the value chain of three major renewable energy technologies: solar
      pv, wind energy, and batteries for electric vehicles (EVs). Using this data,
      we create three separate co-occurrence networks of countries, products, and
      policy instruments. We find that industrial strategy is a path dependent process,
      and that the network structure is informative of policy innovation: countries
      have a tendency to introduce new policies if they are more aligned with the
      policy instruments that are already in place, the products that it already targets,
      or if related countries already have that policy in place. We show that the
      direction of green industrial policy can thus - to some extent - be predicted
      using our networks. One of the three networks is of industrial policy instruments,
      where instruments are connected if they are often co-applied to the same product
      in the same country. Fig. 1 overlays the network with a specific policy innovation
      in India, which was more than four times more likely to be introduced in 2017
      than in a situation where no related policy instrument had already been introduced
      by India on that product before.'

    Talk title: 'Identifying a Novel Medulloblastoma Subgroup: A Multilayer- and Synthetic-Data-Based
      Approach'
    Abstract: 'Medulloblastoma (MB) is a rare childhood brain tumor historically stratified
      into four molecular subgroups: WNT, SHH, Group 3 (G3), and Group 4 (G4). While
      SHH and WNT are widely accepted as separate subgroups, G3 and G4 are currently
      viewed as a continuum within the non-SHH/non-WNT subgroup. The present work
      focuses on this subgroup continuum, as recent research on various omics datasets
      has suggested the existence of a putative, additional G3-G4 subgroup with intermediate
      characteristics. We present findings that identify and characterize the additional
      G3-G4 subgroup using two distinct omics datasets and two distinct methodologies.
      First, we characterized the putative subgroup based on genes'' persistent association
      in multilayer network communities across multi-omics data, and identified patients
      that do not belong to either the G3 nor the G4 subgroups. Given data scarcity
      is a common problem in rare disease analyses, including in transcriptomic data,
      in our second procedure we sought to overcome this limitation by generating
      new, synthetic patients within the G3-G4 subgroup from a microarray study. By
      leveraging the Variational Autoencoder generative ability, we were able to overcome
      the problem of data scarcity and found quantitative support for the G3-G4 subgroup
      definition. Overall, we found a subset of genes that separate the G3-G4 subgroup,
      both through our multilayer network and synthetic-data approaches. These approaches
      show the potential of overcoming dimensionality limitations across different
      data types, enhancing rare disease subtyping tasks and allowing for a deeper
      understanding of the underlying biology.'

    Talk title: Innovation-exnovation dynamics on trees and trusses
    Abstract: Schumpeterian creative destruction most naturally relates innovation
      and its complement exnovation in a linear progression of realized possibilities
      from the past to the present. The phylogenetic tree is a structural variation
      that represents contingent paths of biological innovations to a species. For
      a technological capability, paths are manifold, or a “truss.” We propose a simple
      model for a population of agents innovating while outrunning exnovation to contrast
      the impact of dynamical parameters with structural ones. We calculate its phase
      diagram to show how dynamics and structural connectivity conspire to unleash
      innovative diversity or to drive it extinct.

    Talk title: Connectivity and Community Structure of Online and Register-based
      Social Networks
    Abstract: The dominance of online social media data as a source for large-scale
      social network studies has recently been challenged by networks constructed
      from state-curated register data. In this paper, we investigate how the two
      compare, focusing the Dutch online social network (OSN) Hyves and a register-based
      social network (RSN) of the Netherlands. First and foremost, we find that the
      connectivity of the two population-scale networks is strikingly similar, especially
      between nearby municipalities, with more long-distance ties captured by the
      OSN. This result holds when correcting for population size and geographical
      distance, notwithstanding that these two factors appear to be the main drivers
      of connectivity. Second, we show that the community structure of neither network
      follows strict administrative geographical delineations (e.g., provinces). Instead,
      communities appear to either center around large metropolitan areas or, outside
      of the country's most urbanized area, are comprised of large blocks of interdependent
      municipalities. Beyond population and distance-related patterns, communities
      also highlight the persistence of deeply rooted sociocultural communities that
      can be linked to religion. The findings presented in this work aid in comparing
      results from future studies in which online social networks and register-based
      social networks are used to obtain insights into the social network structure
      of an entire population.

    Talk title: Planted clique detection in geometric network models
    Abstract: Random geometric graphs (RGGs) are often used to model real-life social,
      technological and biological networks. An artificial clique may signal anomaly
      or malicious interventions. We study the problem of detecting such a artificial
      (or, hidden, planted) clique in RGGs. Formally, we consider a RGG where n vertices
      are located at random on a finite two-dimensional torus; two vertices are connected
      if the distance between them is at most r. Then, k vertices are chosen at random
      to form a planted clique by adding the missing edges between them. Our goal
      is to design algorithms that find the planted clique with high probability (w.h.p).  We
      analyze two algorithms. The vertex degree (VD) algorithm declares that the planted
      clique is the k vertices with highest degrees, just as in the earlier literature
      for the Erdös-Rényi (ER) random graphs. We prove that the VD algorithm works
      for k greater than log(n) times the average degree, similarly to the ER model.
      Interestingly, the largest clique in a RGG is much greater than that. Our main
      contribution is the common neighbor (CN) algorithm that works as follows. If
      a pair of vertices has exactly k-2 common neighbors, then CN declares that this
      pair and its common neighbors are the planted clique. We prove that the CN algorithm
      finds a planted clique w.h.p. in a large range of regimes, for instance (surprisingly!)
      when k is finite, while the average degree is of the order log(n).  We conclude
      that even without knowing the positions of the vertices, we can leverage the
      hidden geometry to greatly enhance detection, in comparison to non-geometric
      models.

    Talk title: Benchmarking Algorithmic and Neural Approaches for Temporal Community
      Detection
    Abstract: This work presents an experimental evaluation of algorithmic and neural
      community detection methods for temporal graphs, comparing more established
      approaches with newly introduced deep learning models designed for node-level
      clustering. We devise a novel stochastic block model-based approach 3] to generate
      time-varying attributed temporal graphs with community ground truths, and employ
      it to compare the performance of distinct state-of-the-art solutions. In this
      framework, node features are kept fixed, while community structures are dynamic
      — allowing to study how well differing solutions are able to jointly exploit
      the feature space and the temporal dynamics of the generated graphs to improve
      on the detectability threshold of communities and allow better recovering the
      hidden community structure of the generated networks. In addition, we assess
      the performance of the models on a set of diverse real-world datasets of various
      scales, focused on a transductive learning setting, and extending to an inductive
      learning setting when possible. The main motivation behind this work are the
      recent advances in network representation learning, which have also sparked
      a renewed interest in the improvement and development of new strategies for
      learning on spatio-temporal signals.

    Talk title: Longitudinal Modularity for Uncovering Dynamic Community Structures
      in Link Streams
    Abstract: 'Complex networks are powerful tools for modeling real-world phenomena,
      including social interactions, economic transactions, and biological processes.
      Many of these phenomena are characterized by a continuous flow of interactions
      occurring at fast time scales, often modeled as stream graphs or link streams,
      frameworks specifically designed to handle fine-grained temporal data without
      unnecessary aggregation. Working within this framework necessitates extending
      methods developed for static networks, including the classic problem of community
      detection. In previous work we focused on the well-known modularity quality
      function for community structures in static networks and introduced an extension
      for link streams: the Longitudinal Modularity. This extension does not require
      a predefined time scale of analysis or any preprocessing of the natural temporal
      interactions in the network. In this work, we present an algorithm designed
      to identify time communities in link streams that maximize Longitudinal Modularity.'
