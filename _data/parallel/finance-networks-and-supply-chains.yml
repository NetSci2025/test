  Talk title: Assessing the systemic risk mitigation potential in supply chains through
    network rewiring
  Abstract: The network structure of real-world supply chains inherently carries a
    vulnerability to systemic risk. Local shocks can escalate into widespread disruptions
    due to the high level of interdependence between firms. While recent advances
    have made it possible to quantify systemic risk in production networks, how different
    network topologies of supply links contribute to this risk remains unclear. To
    address this question, we employ a method inspired by statistical physics that
    allows us to find network configurations with minimal systemic risk while respecting
    firm-level constraints to production. Analyzing six subnetworks derived from Hungary's
    and Ecuador's countrywide production networks, we demonstrate that the systemic
    risk can be significantly mitigated without impacting the volume of traded goods
    or firms' production output. A comparison of the network properties before and
    after our optimal rewiring indicates that this result is achieved by changing
    the connectivity in a non-trivial way. These results suggest that production network
    topologies are suboptimal as they carry a level of risk much larger than is necessary
    in order to sustain production. Our findings provide new insights to devise policies
    seeking to reduce systemic risk through targeted interventions in supply chain
    networks.

  Talk title: Spectral signatures of structural change in financial networks
  Abstract: The level of systemic risk in economic and financial systems is strongly
    determined by the structure of the underlying networks of interdependent entities
    that can propagate shocks and stresses. Since changes in network structure imply
    changes in risk levels, it is important to identify structural transitions potentially
    leading to system-wide crises. Methods have been proposed to assess whether a
    real-world network is in a (quasi-)stationary state by checking the consistency
    of its structural evolution with appropriate maximum-entropy ensembles of graphs.
    While previous analyses of this kind have focused on dyadic and triadic motifs,
    hence disregarding higher-order structures, here we consider closed walks of any
    length. Specifically, we study the ensemble properties of the spectral radius
    of random graph models calibrated on real-world evolving networks. Our approach
    is shown to work remarkably well for directed networks, both binary and weighted.
    As illustrative examples, we consider the Electronic Market for Interbank Deposit
    (e-MID), the Dutch Interbank Network (DIN) and the International Trade Network
    (ITN) in their evolution across the 2008 crisis. By monitoring the deviation of
    the spectral radius from its ensemble expectation, we find that the ITN remains
    in a (quasi-)equilibrium state throughout the period considered, while both the
    DIN and e-MID exhibit a clear out-of-equilibrium behaviour. The spectral deviation
    therefore captures ongoing topological changes, extending over all length scales,
    to provide a compact proxy of the resilience of economic and financial networks.

  Talk title: Evolution and robustness of the international trade of food products
  Abstract: The international trade of food products plays an important role in maintaining
    food security across the globe. However, food trade has changed over time, adapting
    to political maneuvers, globalization, and even climatic shocks. Comprehending
    the temporal evolution of food trade networks, and how such changes condition
    the system's robustness can be very valuable for designing effective interventions
    against future crises. To this end, we studied the temporal evolution of global
    food trade networks and characterized how their topological and functional robustness
    changed between 1986-2021. For each year, we built a multiplex representation
    of the trade relationships between 219 countries across 12 food categories (defined
    based on 216 individual products [1]). We then explored the temporal evolution
    of several multiplex network metrics (e.g. participation coefficient, weighted
    overlap, inverse participation ratio) to identify trends that could influence
    network robustness to shocks. Overall, we observed that countries have experienced
    simultaneously an increase in globalization (dependence on imports) and an increase
    in export diversification. This export diversification is not uniform across products,
    with some products exhibiting an increase in regionalization (``Animal and vegetal),
    while others becoming more decentralized (``Grain and derived products"). Such
    heterogeneities may generate discrepancies in each layer's robustness to production
    shocks. To test it, we simulated the impact of single-country production shocks
    in different years. Using a shock model inspired by [2], we evaluated the changes
    in shock size, the most affected countries, and the main shock producers. In the
    case of grain products, though the maximal cascade size generated remains similar
    between 1986 and 2019, there is an increase in the number of countries that could
    potentially cause large cascades...

  Talk title: 'From Source to Sink: A Route-Based Approach to Supply Chain Stability'
  Abstract: Modern global trade networks are characterized by complex interdependencies,
    making supply chain stability for critical commodities a key concern. Expanding
    the range of trade partners may seem like a straightforward way to enhance resilience,
    but it can still leave countries exposed if partners rely on the same upstream
    suppliers. This highlights the need for a more comprehensive approach that traces
    commodities from their sources to final consumption.We adapt the power tracing
    technique from electrical grid analysis [1] to address this issue. Originally
    designed to quantify dependencies between generators and consumers by analyzing
    electricity flows, we apply this concept to trace commodity pathways in global
    trade. Using a Markov chain model, our framework simulates the flow of goods and
    reconstructs observed trade distributions, revealing risks and structural dependencies.
    We further develop a multilayer framework linking commodity flows across stages
    of production.We demonstrate the framework's utility through its application to
    Lithium-Ion Batteries (LIBs) for electric vehicles (EVs). By tracing materials
    like lithium from mining to final consumption, we identify supply chains balancing
    route diversity with environmental and human rights standards. This perspective
    reveals key vulnerabilities and offers strategic guidance for resilient trade
    portfolios. At the global level, it pinpoints critical hubs and potential failure
    points that could disrupt supply chains. Incorporating raw materials, intermediate
    goods, and final products, our method provides a unified framework for analyzing
    interdependencies and their impacts.

  Talk title: Inferring firm-level supply chain networks with realistic systemic risk
    from industry sector-level data
  Abstract: 'Inter-firm networks have been shown to play a crucial role in the propagation
    and amplification of economic shocks at the national level: as such, knowledge
    of these systems is of capital importance in order to properly address economic
    resilience to disruptive events. Comprehensive data about supply chains is, however,
    seldom available, triggering a flourishing literature about reconstruction models,
    aimed at predicting the most probable configurations of these networks starting
    from the partial, available, information. In this work we test different network
    reconstruction models rooted in the Maximum Entropy framework, namely the stripe-corrected
    Gravity Model (scGM), the Input-Output scGM (IO scGM), introduced in the paper,
    and the density-corrected Gravity Model (dcGM), on the reconstruction the Ecuadorian
    production network, accessed through a unique dataset provided by the Ecuadorian
    Tax Office. Differently from previous reconstruction attempts, here we focus on
    the ability of the models to correctly identify firm-level systemic risk, as measured
    by ESRI. The scGM displays the best overall reconstruction performance, proving
    to be able to generate reliable synthetic networks both from a structural and
    from an economic point of view, despite requiring very limited information on
    the empirical network (namely the sector-specific in- and out-strength of firms):
    when this information is not available, it can be well approximated by the fluxes
    between industrial sectors, as in the IO scGM. Our findings shed light on the
    minimal amount of empirical information that is needed in order to generate realistic
    synthetic production networks, able to capture the systemic risk of an economy.'

  Talk title: Digital twins of economic and financial networks
  Abstract: Digital twins are virtual replicas of real-world systems, enabling the
    study of economic and financial systems while preserving data confidentiality.
    We propose a framework for building digital twins tailored to these systems, using
    Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) turned into fitness-based, generative
    models. These models capture structural features while abstracting sensitive data,
    enabling secure data sharing and promoting reproducibility in economic and financial
    network studies. Fitness-based ERGMs transform constraints like degree distribution
    moments into measurable properties such as economic size or trade volume.We analyze
    linear models (e.g., the Configuration Model) and non-linear models (e.g., the
    Two-Star and Degree-Corrected Two-Star Models) on e-MID, the Dutch Interbank Network,
    and the International Trade Network (ITN), focusing on their evolution during
    the 2008 crisis. The fitness-induced Configuration Model \emph{i)} solves quickly
    via the fixed point of its induced map; \emph{ii)} reproduces node degrees accurately;
    and \emph{iii)} induces a core-periphery structure, though it underestimates degree
    variance.To address this, we studied non-linear models like the Two-Star and Degree-Corrected
    Two-Star Models (solved via mean-field approximation). By constraining two-stars
    (V-motifs), these models address degree variance. For the ITN in 2000, the Two-Star
    Model overestimates degree variance, while the Degree-Corrected Two-Star Model
    provides closer estimates but adds little value over the simpler Configuration
    Model. This reflects the ITN‚Äôs dependence on node degrees, confirmed by the Bayesian
    Information Criterion.Our goal is to create accurate virtual replicas of economic
    and financial systems to assess systemic risk and plan policies while preserving
    data privacy. Reproducing the second moment of the degree distribution remains
    crucial to this aim.
