  Talk title: Spatial aggregation areas for infectious contact network inferred from
    pathogen sequence data
  Abstract: As contact tracing is costly and usually provides subjective and fragmented
    data, study of infectious contact networks is difficult, especially for systems
    with complex transmission patterns. The genetic distance between pathogen sequence
    data, is correlated to the proximity of contacts on a transmission tree and is
    a direct insight into the contact patterns driving the spread of infection in
    a community or ecosystem. As such genetic distance can be used to determine the
    size of aggregation areas in spatial network by finding the best scales for aggregations
    of variables.  The transmission dynamics of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza
    (HPAI) is complex as it spans multiple bird species and production systems. To
    quantify the scales of potentially infectious interactions we use the genetic
    distances between HPAI H5N1 sequences in the 2020-2022 from Great Britain with
    the set of other variables (i.e. number of cases, wild bird abundance and poultry
    farms count) calculated over various geographical scales1. We demonstrate that
    spatial scales of aggregation depend both on the variable and the time of analysis.
    Variables that are directly describing HPAI outbreaks (number of wild and domestic
    bird cases) have different scales of aggregation for the variable type and period
    of analysis, while indirectly correlated, constant in time variables (wild bird
    abundance and farm density) generally have the same scale for both analysed periods.
    Our study shows that the interactions driving complex transmission systems are
    variable, and separate spatial networks may need to be considered to represent
    a range of epidemiological interactions. The network with time dynamic spatial
    aggregation may be necessary for variables directly describing temporal changes
    of outbreaks.1 Gamża, A., Lycett, S., Sanchez, A. & Kao, R. Using sequence data

  Talk title: 'Epidemic network model combining sexual and household transmissions:
    application to the mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo'
  Abstract: A new strain of the mpox virus (clade Ib) emerged in the eastern Democratic
    Republic of Congo (DRC) in September 2023, spreading rapidly to neighboring countries.
    While the transmission is primarily driven by sexual contacts, the prolonged reporting
    of mpox cases among young children suggests a significant role of household contacts.
    This outbreak in the DRC has driven the development of a network epidemic model
    that incorporates both age and two transmission modes - household and sexual -
    to project the required control effort and compare targeted intervention strategies
    under various scenarios. In our model, sexual contacts are repeated contacts within
    partnerships, and household contacts are treated as one-off contacts. Additionally,
    contact patterns are age dependent. The spread of an susceptible-exposedinfectious-recovered
    (SEIR) infection is superimposed on the network. This network model, combining
    the two types of contacts, is described by a set of ordinary differential equations
    (ODE), incorporating a configuration network structure and mass action contact
    structure, allowing for mathematical analysis. Model parameters were selected
    to reflect the clade Ib mpox outbreak setting in the DRC. Our approach enables
    us to compare model outcomes to collected data, such as age-specific incidence
    in the initial phase of an epidemic. Furthermore, we can explore optimal vaccination
    strategies at different phases of the epidemic, determine when the dominant mode
    of transmission might switch from sexual to household transmission, potentially
    requiring a change in intervention priorities. Our findings demonstrate that this
    analytically tractable mathematical model of epidemic spread on a network combining
    household and sexual contacts can provide valuable insights into real-life outbreaks.
    The clade Ib mpox outbreak in the DRC serves as a practical application, highlighting
    its potential for public health insights into optimal control strategies.

  Talk title: Modelling the effects of COVID-19 mobility disruptions on RSV transmission
    in Seattle, Washington
  Abstract: Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection is a major cause of acute
    respiratory hospitalizations in young children and older adults. In early 2020
    most countries implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to slow the
    spread of SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 NPIs disrupted the transmission of RSV on a global
    scale, and many locations did not experience widespread recirculation until late
    2020 or 2021. Here, we use a dynamic mathematical model to investigate the impacts
    of human mobility on the reemergence of RSV in Seattle, Washington.We characterized
    within-city mixing, in-flows, and foot traffic to points of interest (POIs) using
    SafeGraph mobility data. We calibrated an age-structured epidemic model to data
    on weekly RSV hospitalizations in Seattle-King County, WA (2017–2023), allowing
    for fluctuations in transmission due to changes in mobility during the pandemic.
    We focused on mobility metrics that may best approximate transmission-relevant
    contacts, spatial spread, or external case importations and used maximum likelihood
    to determine the best-fitting models.COVID-19 NPIs perturbed RSV seasonality from
    2020 to 2022. Seattle experienced a small out-of-season outbreak in Summer 2021
    and an atypically large and early wave in Fall 2022. Transmission models incorporating
    mobility network connectivity (measured as the mean shortest path length between
    Seattle neighborhoods) or the inflow of visitors residing outside of Seattle most
    accurately captured the timing and magnitude of the first two post-pandemic waves,
    outperforming models that included foot traffic to schools or child daycares (Figure
    1).These results suggest that case importations from other regions and local spread
    between neighborhoods had the greatest influence on the timing of RSV reemergence
    in Seattle. Our study contributes crucial insights into the behavioral factors
    underlying RSV epidemic spread and could potentially inform preventative measures,
    such as the timing of immunizations.

  Talk title: Adaptive behavior in response to the 2022 mpox epidemic in the Paris
    region
  Abstract: Background. The 2022 mpox outbreak saw a rapid case surge among men-who-have-sex-with-men
    (MSM) in previously unaffected regions, driven by heterogeneity in sexual networks.
    A sudden decline followed, but its drivers remain unclear as it is difficult to
    distinguish the roles of vaccination, herd immunity, and behavioral changes.Methods.
    We developed a network model of mpox transmission among MSM based on sexual behavior
    data (Figure 1a) and fitted it to the Paris region epidemic. We studied whether
    the decline was driven by post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) vaccination, immunity
    among highly active MSM, or behavioral changes. Behavioral shifts were modeled
    as either uniform or based on individual risk factors, like sexual activity or
    exposure to diagnosed cases. We used the cross-sectional 2023 ERAS survey to validate
    findings.Findings. Behavioral changes adopted by 49% (95%CI 47-51%) of MSM regardless
    of individual risk factors best explained the observed epidemic decline (Figures
    1b, 1c). These changes prevented an estimated 73% (28-99%) of mpox cases in summer
    2022. Findings aligned with the ERAS survey data, showing that 46% (45-48%) of
    MSM reduced sexual partners (Figure 1c). On the contrary, PEP vaccination and
    immunity among highly active MSM were insufficient to curb the outbreak.Interpretation.
    Widespread behavioral change was the primary driver of the mpox epidemic decline
    in the Paris region, before preventive vaccination or immunity could affect epidemic
    spread. These findings highlight the importance of effective risk communication
    and community engagement in outbreak management. Tailored public health responses
    that encourage adaptive behaviors, especially as vaccination efforts ramp up,
    are essential for supporting affected communities.

  Talk title: 'Age-infection matrix inference from genetic sequence data: a machine
    learning approach'
  Abstract: Epidemic models are indispensable tools for operational tasks, for instance
    by revealing the infection dynamics between age groups during a pandemic situation.
    However, evaluating the performance of these models is often hindered by limited
    data availability; while advanced surveillance systems may report age-stratified
    case numbers, the number of infections between different age groups is generally
    unknown. We address this limitation by incorporating an additional dataset, clinical
    genetic sequences with age metadata, to infer age-infection matrices (AIMs) through
    a machine learning approach.As training data, we generate synthetic AIMs and genetic
    sequence data using the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered epidemic models on complete
    networks weighted by the age-contact structure collected in the POLYMOD survey
    in 9 European countries in 2006. We validate our estimator on synthetic data generated
    from the CoMix survey, collected during the COVID-19 pandemic. We apply our trained
    model to Belgian genetic sequences downloaded form the GISAID database, and obtain
    AIMs for each month of 2021. The obtained results are in agreement with, and extend
    the information in reported age-stratified case numbers. As an example, they reveal
    the diagonal and off-diagonal structures of the AIMs in the months of January
    and October 2021, respectively. These patterns match the structure of the contact
    matrices recorded by the CoMix survey at the same time, even though the CoMix
    matrices were not part of the training data. Beyond acting as a rough proxy for
    contact matrices when they are unavailable, the estimated AIMs can reveal additional
    factors influencing infection patterns, such as age-dependent susceptibility and
    immunity within the population. We believe that our proposed method is an ambitious
    and important step towards a new generation of operational epidemic models, which
    integrate genetic sequence data in addition to traditional surveillance reports.

  Talk title: Estimates of the reproduction ratio from epidemic surveillance may be
    biased in spatially structured populations
  Abstract: 'Accurate estimates of the reproduction ratio (Rt) are crucial for projecting
    the evolution of an infectious disease epidemic and for guiding the public health
    response. During epidemics, estimates of Rt typically come from surveillance data,
    e.g., time series ofrecorded cases. However, we prove that estimates of the reproduction
    ratio based on inference from surveillance data can be inaccurate if the population
    is made up of a network of spatially distinct communities, as the space–mobility
    interplay may hide the true evolution of the epidemic from surveillance data.
    Consequently, we prove that traditional epidemiological surveillance may underestimate
    the reproduction ratio over long periods, even to the points of mistaking growing
    epidemics as subsiding ones. To address this, we use the spectral properties of
    the operator describing the epidemic coupling among spatialcommunities to quantify
    this error, and to propose a correction that removes it across all epidemic phases,
    by reweighing surveillance data by the leading eigenvector of this operator. We
    validate this correction against simulated epidemics and use COVID-19 in France
    as a case study. Specifically, we find evidence that biased estimates of Rt during
    the rise of the Alpha variant in early 2021 might have contributed to delaying
    public health interventions, ultimately making it necessary to enforce the third
    national lockdown. We show that our correction, if available, would have correctly
    indicated the growth of the Alpha variant. Beyond this retrospective case study,
    however, our results apply to any epidemic in which mobility is a driver of circulation.
    Our findings may help improve epidemic monitoring and surveillance and inform
    strategies for public health responses.Ref: Birello P, et.al. Nature Physics 20,
