  Talk title: Mechanisms of Symmetry Breaking in Optimal Networks
  Abstract: Finding the optimal flow through a given network is relevant in a wide
    range of systems, including urban transportation, power grids, river basins, plant
    and animal venation. Gaining insight into the mechanisms behind the structure
    of optimal networks is of crucial importance, especially in the context of designing
    transport systems. Many such systems involve multiple modes or layers of transport,
    motivating the study of optimal flow in multiplex networks.In this article we
    introduce an analytically solvable model for symmetry breaking in optimal networks.
    We provide a comprehensive solution for elementary model networks and demonstrate
    two different mechanisms of symmetry breaking. First, the optimal state can undergo
    a bifurcation, such that the symmetric state vanishes entirely. Second, the symmetric
    and the symmetry-broken state co-exist and exchange roles as global and local
    minima of the optimisation problem.We extend our fundamental results to (i) study
    the impact of uncertain supply and demand and (ii) the optimal structure of multilayer
    networks. Combining analytic and numeric tools, we show how noise impacts the
    emergence to symmetry breaking and construct the phase diagram. For multi-layer
    networks, we demonstrate symmetry breaking between layers, where one layer carries
    the entire flow despite a symmetry in supply and demand between the layers.Our
    results can hold importance for future energy systems, where electricity, gas
    and heat networks are integrated and generation becomes increasingly uncertain.

  Talk title: The enhanced geometry in multiplex networks
  Abstract: Multiplex networks provide a powerful multilayer framework for modeling
    complex systems with diverse interaction types. The different layers are expected
    to be correlated, a fact that has been confirmed in previous works. However, a
    comprehensive analysis of the overlap caused by such correlations has been lacking,
    especially for higher order structures. We show that the mutual clustering coefficient
    -- a measure for the amount of triangles present in all layers -- is high in many
    real networks. This result can be explained through an enhanced coupling of the
    overlapping edges to the underlying metric space, which conditions their connectivity.

  Talk title: Predicting shortest path nodes in random geometric graphs
  Abstract: 'Conventional network-based algorithms may not work efficiently in certain
    circumstances, including when facing enormous network sizes and incomplete or
    inaccurate networks, such as missing links. To address this challenge, one possible
    method is identifying the shortest path based on network geometry. In this work,
    we aim to investigate, in a direct way, the extent the shortest paths are aligned
    along geodesic curves in Euclidean geometric networks and if it can be used to
    infer shortest paths. We show that the deviation, i.e. the distance from a node
    to the geodesic, of a node belonging to the shortest path is smaller than the
    deviation of randomly selected nodes. Additionally, we demonstrate that the deviation
    of the nodes comprising the shortest path decreases as network size increases.
    However, an increment in the expected degree leads to a non-monotonic behaviour
    characterized by the presence of a local minimum deviation. We investigate the
    monotonic behaviour in three distinct phases: the initial growth arises from the
    connectivity transition, the tail is dominated by large degree and the middle
    phase reflects the interplay between these two factors. To investigate the significance
    of shortest path alignment, we ask if it can be used to infer shortest paths.
    To this end, we consider the shortest path problem in a geometric network where
    only nodes, node coordinates and connection probabilities are known to the observer.
    We try to find the shortest paths based on the vicinity to geodesic curves and
    also by first reconstructing networks. Our method shows promising potential: identifying
    shortest path nodes using deviation is not only computationally efficient, but
    also robust to blurred coordinates in SRGGs across various network topologies,
    which can benefit practical scenarios where the coordinates of nodes are not fixed
    or precisely known. Specifically, the benefits of our method become higher as
    noise increases.'

  Talk title: Mapping bipartite networks into multidimensional hyperbolic spaces
  Abstract: 'When nodes can be divided into two disjoint sets and no links connect
    two nodes in the same set a network is called bipartite. There are many examples
    of such networks as collaboration networks (authors and articles), actor networks
    (actors and movies), metabolic networks (metabolites and chemical reactions),
    and many more. Despite their abundance, these networks are less studied compared
    to unipartite networks. Recent works show that network geometry framework can
    be extended to bipartite networks in which nodes of both types lie in a metric
    space, and the connection depends on their distance. In this work, we extend the
    current one-dimensional model into $D$ dimensions by introducing a bipartite-$\mathbb{S}^D/\mathbb{H}^{D+1}$
    model when nodes of two kinds lie in the same $D$-dimensional similarity space.
    Moreover, we develop an embedding framework that allows the creation of multidimensional
    hyperbolic maps of real bipartite networks. Using this framework, we analyzed
    two datasets: Unicodelang and Flavour datasets. In the first one, countries are
    connected to the languages spoken in that region. In the second one, food ingredients
    are coupled with the food compounds. Moreover, we apply our approach in the machine
    learning context, where a node feature matrix is represented as a bipartite graph.
    Our tests on the node classification and link prediction tasks show a significant
    improvement when a correlation between nodes'' labels and nodes'' features is
    high. The findings pinpoint the cases in which a unipartite network is redundant
    or not when a feature matrix is known.'

  Talk title: Random Hyperbolic Graphs with Arbitrary Mesoscale Structures
  Abstract: Key features of real-world networks include sparsity, the small-world
    property, inhomogeneous degree distribution, high clustering coefficients, and
    community structure. So-called Random Hyperbolich Graphs (RHG) can naturally explain
    many of these observed network features by assuming that nodes are embedded in
    hidden metric space having negative curvature.RHG models provide direct control
    on the degree distribution and transitivity of the generated networks, and can
    produce networks with strong community structures, even without explicitly incorporating
    community-generating mechanisms. However, they lack parameters to control the
    existence of blocks – or communities – with specific mixing patterns, another
    common feature in real-world networks.To address these limitations, we introduce
    the Random Hyperbolic Block Model (RHBM), a max-entropy network model obtained
    constraining the expected total energy of the system, degree sequence and mixing
    matrix. The RHBM extends both the degree-corrected stochastic block model and
    the S1 model, enjoying a combination of their properties.To highlight the utility
    of the RHBM, we use it to both generate synthetic networks and to randomize real
    networks. By using the d-mercator embedding tool, we find the maximum-likelihood
    underlying geometry of these networks, to show that some of them are “non-geometric”,
    in the sense that purely geometric models cannot reproduce the input community
    structure, while the RHBM can. Our findings suggest that the popularity-similarity
    principle underlying hyperbolic models cannot explain mesoscale structures like
    communities, and that an additional term in the expressionof edge probabilities
    is required.
