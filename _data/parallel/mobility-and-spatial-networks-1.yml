  Talk title: Concise variable-order networks from path data
  Abstract: While they are defined at the micro-scale of nodes and edges, a key feature
    of networks is their ability to capture structure across scales by modelling indirect
    interactions as paths and walks. This assumes that flow along edges is transitive
    and can be represented as a first-order Markov model. However, trajectory or path
    data from a variety of systems such as passenger itineraries, career paths, and
    clickstreams have higher-order dependencies that first-order networks cannot capture.
    In this work, we present a pipeline to create 'concise' networks that interpolate
    between first and second-order models by capitalising on patterns in second-order
    effects. At the core of our method, we use Convex Non-negative Matrix Factorisation
    to create state nodes that model latent modes of behaviour. Our method includes
    an interpretable measure to guide the complexity-quality trade-off, a prior to
    regularise the data, and is designed to process nodes in parallel. In addition
    to showing that it recovers planted modes of behaviour in synthetic data, we explore
    the insights created by our method into two real-world systems. First, from flight
    itineraries in the US, we uncover intuitive transit behaviour through national
    hubs, revealing their role in routing passengers across geographic regions. Second,
    we show that despite being much less complex, our concise network model captures
    the modular structure of a full second-order model of information flow on a social
    network.

  Talk title: Minimum-cost percolation on US air transportation network
  Abstract: 'Transportation infrastructure systems are the backbone of our society,
    fostering economic growth and driving innovation by conveying people and goods
    from origin to destination in a timely manner. Successful operation of these infrastructures
    depends on efficient routing of origin-destination demands given a fixed amount
    of resources available. Here, we extend the previous framework of the shortest-path
    percolation, which is a stylized model defined on a simple graph describing how
    the macroscopic structure of the transportation system collapses as resources
    are consumed to fulfill the origin-destination demands, considering a generalized
    structure of the transportation network with time-stamp, directionality, weight,
    and capacity: the minimum-cost percolation (MCP) model. We applied the MCP framework
    to the US air transportation system using publicly available data and conducted
    extensive experiments considering various costs and different origin-destination
    demands. Our results indicate that cooperation among airline carriers through
    shared flights can significantly improve the overall efficiency of the US air
    transportation system. These findings demonstrate the potential of the MCP framework
    to guide cooperative policies that enhance resource utilization and overall efficiency.'

  Talk title: Behavioral response to mobile phone evacuation alerts
  Abstract: SMS-based alerts during emergencies are a highly effective communication
    tool due to their broad reach, low cost, and immediacy [1]. However, overly broad
    alerts can lead to over-evacuation, straining infrastructure, and eroding public
    trust. We analyzed the SMS-based alerts issued during Chile’s most devastating
    wildfire in 30 years, which struck Valpara\'so on February 2, 2024, causing 137
    fatalities and affecting over 16,000 people. Using spatio-temporal data from a
    national mobile network and census-based proxies for socioeconomic status (SES),
    we categorized telecommunication towers into lower, middle, and higher SES groups.
    Official alerts from SENAPRED provided the timing and location of evacuation messages,
    while to analyse people's mobility, we employed XDR spatio-temporal data from
    a national mobile communication company.Our findings show that the first SMS alert
    prompted significant evacuation behavior across all SES groups, regardless of
    proximity to the wildfire (Figure 1a). Higher SES areas exhibited fewer connections
    (Figure 1b), suggesting greater capacity for proactive evacuation. Interrupted
    time-series analysis confirmed that the initial alert was the primary driver of
    evacuation, with higher SES evacuations influenced more by prudence than direct
    alert targeting (Figure 1c). Our findings show several interesting patterns; initial
    alerts elicit stronger responses, repeated alerts risk desensitization, and SES
    shapes evacuation patterns, with higher SES groups better positioned to act. These
    insights inform strategies to enhance emergency communication, ensuring precision
    and improved safety for all communities.

  Talk title: Behavior-based contact structure in mobility networks
  Abstract: Contact networks, which describe individuals' physical interactions, have
    broad applications for understanding diffusion processes in social networks, from
    the spread of information to the transmission of infectious disease. Commonly,
    contact networks are segmented by individuals' demographic characteristics, showing
    the contact probabilities (or "mixing") between different demographic sub-populations.
    While demographic-stratification of contact networks can reveal important structure
    in the patterns of interaction within a population, demographic features do not
    fully capture behavioral differences between individuals. In this project, we
    build on existing research identifying latent behavioral patterns in individual
    activity, which looks below the level of individual demographics to identify common
    patterns of activity across individuals' lifestyles. Using detailed GPS mobility
    data describing individuals' patterns of visitation to points of interest, we
    use Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), a machine learning dimensionality
    reduction technique, to identify the key behavioral components which describe
    individuals' mobility activity. This is analogous to identifying the fundamental
    "genes" which, when taken together, form an individual's unique lifestyle. After
    decomposing individual-level mobility data into behavioral components, we compute
    contact networks between individuals based on their proximity in space and time.
    We then compare observed patterns of interaction with respect to the distribution
    of individuals' latent behavioral features. Our approach can highlight behavioral
    homophily in networks, were contacts occur more frequently between individuals
    with similar behavioral characteristics, and behavior-based community structure
    which is not captured by demographic features.

  Talk title: Mobility and cohesion of personal networks over the lifecourse of an
    entire population
  Abstract: Changing technology fosters higher levels of human mobility creating both
    new connections between faraway places and rearranging the spatial structure of
    already existing connections. Both mechanisms and their impact on network topology
    are little understood in the literature.In this work, we address this gap by leveraging
    a unique longitudinal population-scale network dataset sourced from Statistics
    Netherlands. This network contains family, work, school, household, and next-door
    neighbor connections derived from administrative registers, that together constitute
    a multilayer social opportunity structure for all residents of the Netherlands
    between 2009 and 2022. We follow the patterns of individuals’ ego networks over
    time, and measure their size, closure, and geographical dispersion.First, we show
    that while the average size of ego networks stays stable over the observed period,
    average closure drops by as much as 10%, leading to more open local network structures.
    Second,  we see that the average geographical distance from network neighbors
    grows, and in parallel, the average share of network neighbors in the same municipality
    decreases. Third, we link the two using multivariate difference-in-difference
    type regressions which show that the observed decrease in the closure is indeed
    significantly linked to the growing geographic dispersion. The regressions thus
    confirm that people’s mobility is linked to more open ego networks, which potentially
    impacts on people’s access to information, or the level of trust in communities.This
    work is among the first ones that aims to map the temporal network of an entire
    population structure comprehensively [2]. As such, it offers a starting point
    for a wide variety of impactful network  science research at the level of a complete
    population.

  Talk title: Dynamic models of gentrification
  Abstract: The phenomenon of gentrification of an urban area is characterized by
    the displacement of lower-income residents due to rising living costs and an influx
    of wealthier individuals. This study presents an agent-based model that simulates
    urban gentrification through the relocation of three income groups -- low, middle,
    and high -- driven by living costs. The model incorporates economic and sociological
    theories to generate realistic neighborhood transition patterns. We introduce
    a temporal network-based measure to track the outflow of low-income residents
    and the inflow of middle- and high-income residents over time. Our experiments
    reveal that high-income residents trigger gentrification and that our network-based
    measure consistently detects gentrification patterns earlier than traditional
    count-based methods, potentially serving as an early detection tool in real-world
    scenarios. Moreover, the analysis highlights how city density promotes gentrification.
    This framework offers valuable insights for understanding gentrification dynamics
    and informing urban planning and policy decisions.
