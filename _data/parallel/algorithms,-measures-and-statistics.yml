  Talk title: Longest Path and Main Path Analysis of Directed Acyclic Graphs
  Abstract: (Abbreviated abstract, see pdf for figure and full text) Innovation leaves
    its marks in many documents. For technical innovations, academic papers, patents,
    and documents related to formal medical trials and approvals all contain references
    to relevant earlier work in their bibliography. Thus, the flow of ideas is encoded
    in the links made by citations between documents. These define a citation network
    (Price, 1965), where documents are the nodes, and there is a directed link from
    an older to a newer document when the older document is listed in the bibliography
    of the newer document. This is a DAG (a directed acyclic graph) and the tools
    used to analyse a DAG must consider the inherent order in a DAG.One of the main
    tools used has been “main path analysis” proposed by Hummon and Doreian (1989)
    but used in many studies since then, e.g. it is available in the pajek network
    analysis package. Yet, main path analysis was proposed in an ad hoc manner and
    so the support for main path analysis rests on expert opinion in these later studies.
    Recently, we showed that the path of innovation can be studied using the longest
    path in a DAG (Ho et al., 2024a,b). The longest path is a natural measure for
    any DAG, e.g. it is linked to the geodesic in simple spacetime DAG models (Brightwell
    & Gregory 1991).We review the methods and results for large vaccine approval citation
    networks from Ho et al. (2024a,b). We will then compare the main path method used
    elsewhere (SPC in figure) and the longest path method that proved effective for
    the vaccine data. We will do this on simple toy models, some based on simple geometries,
    others on more realistic citation networks. We will also develop a new main path-like
    method based on information (SPE path in figure). Our conclusion is that Ho et
    al.'s (2024a,b) approach using the longest path is simpler, better motivated,
    and more effective than the historical main path method and our newer information-theoretic
    approach.

  Talk title: Navigating the privacy vs. utility trade-off in network anonymization
  Abstract: Data on social connectivity and human interaction is frequently used in
    social network analysis and network science research. However, since these network
    datasets can contain information on individual entities, publishing or sharing
    them can lead to a breach of privacy. Even after pseudonymization, i.e., removing
    identifiers such as a person’s name, individuals can still be identified based
    on their surrounding network structure. In this work, we study approaches for
    anonymizing networks through perturbation to alleviate these privacy concerns.
    We aim to do so while still ensuring data utility, i.e., the extent to which the
    network data remains useful for analysis. This means ensuring retention of topological
    properties, but also robustness in results of, e.g., community detection or node
    ranking based on centrality. We focus on k-anonymity with k = 2, implying that
    nodes are deemed anonymous if they are not at a structurally unique position.
    This allows us to summarize anonymity for a given network by uniqueness, i.e.,
    the fraction of unique nodes in the network. To optimize k-anonymity, i.e., minimize
    uniqueness, anonymization algorithms alter a network by means of edge deletion
    to obtain a perturbed network. We compare five such algorithms, targeting edges
    based on different criteria. In our experiments, we compare the five algorithms
    on 17 real-world datasets ranging from hundreds to thousands of nodes. Overall,
    results show that our heuristic algorithms achieve far better results compared
    to a random baseline in terms of both anonymity and utility; important steps towards
    automated techniques for meaningful anonymization of networks.

  Talk title: Network mutual information measures for graph similarity
  Abstract: A wide range of tasks in network analysis, such as clustering network
    populations or identifying anomalies in temporal graph streams, require a measure
    of the similarity between two graphs. To provide a meaningful data summary for
    downstream scientific analyses, the graph similarity measures used for these tasks
    must be principled, interpretable, and capable of distinguishing meaningful overlapping
    network structure from statistical noise at different scales of interest. Here
    we derive a family of graph mutual information measures that satisfy these criteria
    and are constructed using only fundamental information theoretic principles. Our
    measures capture the information shared among networks according to different
    encodings of their structural information, with our mesoscale mutual information
    measure allowing for network comparison under any specified network coarse-graining.
    We test our measures in a range of applications on real and synthetic network
    data, finding that they effectively highlight intuitive aspects of network similarity
    across scales in a variety of systems.

  Talk title: A comparison of network sampling techniques that preserve local structure
  Abstract: Preserving important structural properties is a fundamental challenge
    in constructing robust null models for networks. The dk-series framework provides
    a systematic methodology for defining and controlling the structural complexity
    of network models, from degree sequences (1k) to higher-order subgraph motifs
    (2k, 3k, etc.). However, sampling networks that preserve higher-order constraints
    (i.e., 3k and above) remains computationally challenging, significantly limiting
    the practical applicability of this framework in real-world analyses. This work
    systematically evaluates a suite of null models designed to preserve local structures,
    including motif counts, degree correlations, and higher-order patterns. Our goal
    is to balance the theoretical rigor of the dk-series framework with computational
    feasibility. To this end, we introduce the d-Motif Configuration Model (d-MCM),
    a novel extension of Karrer & Newman (2010) based on the dk-series framework,
    which probabilistically preserves motif structures and degree correlations. The
    d-MCM model builds on the strengths of the dk-series while addressing its computational
    limitations through innovative sampling techniques. We compare the d-MCM approach
    to other null models, including the dk-series and Neighborhood Structure Configuration
    Models (NeSt), across various levels of structural preservation (e.g., 1k, 2k,
    3k-series, and NeSt with neighborhood sizes between 1 and 5). Using the dk-series
    as a unifying framework, we evaluate these methods on synthetic and empirical
    networks by documenting properties that are and are not preserved, including degree
    distributions, clustering coefficients, and motif frequencies. Additionally, we
    assess their ability to generate new graphs that are non-isomorphic to the original
    network.

  Talk title: 'Impact of Incomplete Data on Character Network Extraction: The Case
    of Comics'
  Abstract: 'Most of humanity’s literature has been lost .For example, of the eight
    Trojan epics, only the Iliad and Odyssey havesurvived in full. A commonality between
    many culture’s myths and epics, is that they frequently have shared characters
    which allow us to create and study a large social network.In previous analyses
    of sagas and epic literature centrality measures such as the betweenness centrality
    strongly correlate with character importance. However, a key issue with this analysis
    is that we have no accurate estimate for how much of the social network is intact,
    even when creating one with all available narratives from one culture. Many texts
    are still missing and the ones we have frequently incomplete.In this study, we
    focus on  a dataset we have that is almost complete to test the effect of information
    loss (i.e. incomplete texts) and source loss (i.e. missing narratives). Marvel
    and DC are two of the largest comic-book publishing houses in the world, each
    with an average of 500 comics per year since the 1960s. We use data from the Grand
    Comics Database to obtain estimates for the effect of source loss from a complex-networks
    perspective.We perform simulations representing information loss (random edge
    removal) and source loss (random comic removal).We split the comics into periods
    of years known as “ages” which are pre-defined by the comic-book community. We
    find that using the different ages, different sets of characters, simulating random-comic
    loss or random-edge loss, all results are similar: once a sizeable amount of information
    is lost, some of the central characters become less important to the network.
    This has major implications for our understanding of central characters in world
    mythology.'

  Talk title: Multiscale Temporal Node Assortativity in Feature-rich Temporal Networks
  Abstract: The assortativity coefficient in static networks measures the tendency
    of nodes to connect to other nodes with similar or dissimilar attributes, such
    as age, gender, or political views. While extensively studied in static networks
    across fields like biology and social networks, its exploration in temporal networks
    remains limited. Citaro et al developed an assortativity measure for categorical
    attributes, but assortativity for scalar attributes has not been generalized to
    temporal networks yet. The typical approach often analyzes temporal networks by
    aggregating them into static snapshots, which overlook the temporal order of connections
    and may lead to misleading results. To address this, we propose a multiscale temporal
    assortativity framework that captures the temporal intricacies of high-resolution
    temporal networks and can be applied to categorical and scalar attributes.Assortativity
    on static networks can be interpreted as the autocorrelation with a time lag of
    1 of attributes visited by a random walker moving on the network. We generalized
    this idea to temporal networks by modeling a continuous-time random walk (CTRW)
    with jumping rate on fine-grained temporal networks and introduce temporal assortativity
    as the correlation of attributes visited by the random walker. We also derive
    a local temporal assortativity by considering CTRWs with initial probability localized
    on a specific node.Our framework generalizes assortativity measures for temporal
    networks that capture temporal and topological multi-scale effects. This is particularly
    valuable for understanding network generation processes and estimating the impact
    of homophily on network dynamics.
