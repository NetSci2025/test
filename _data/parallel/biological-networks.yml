  Talk title: Discovering causal gene subnetworks responsible for complex traits
  Abstract: The relationship between genotype and phenotype remains an outstanding
    question for organism-level traits because these traits are generally complex.
    The challenge arises from complex traits being determined by a combination of
    multiple genes (or loci), which leads to an explosion of possible genotype-phenotype
    mappings. The primary techniques to resolve these mappings are genome/transcriptome-wide
    association studies, which are limited by the fact that they do not account for
    how molecular level changes propagate through regulatory networks, and their lack
    of causal inference and statistical power. Here, we develop an approach that leverages
    transcriptional data and takes into account the network-structured nature of responses
    to experimental gene perturbations, and a generative machine learning model to
    strengthen statistical power. Our implementation of the approach—dubbed TWAVE—includes
    a variational autoencoder trained on human transcriptional data, which is incorporated
    into an optimization framework. TWAVE generates trait expression profiles, which
    we dimensionally reduce by identifying independently varying generalized pathways
    (eigengenes). We then conduct constrained optimization to combinations of gene
    perturbations (and thus causal gene sets) whose measured transcriptomic responses
    best account for trait differences. These optimal combinations enable the construction
    of co-perturbation networks, where two gene perturbations are connected if the
    transcriptomic response to the combined perturbations tend to have more effect
    on phenotype than either of the single gene perturbations. By considering several
    complex traits, we show that the approach identifies causal genes that cannot
    be detected by the primary existing techniques. We suggest that the approach be
    used to design tailored experiments to identify multi-genic targets to address
    complex diseases.

  Talk title: Exploring cis gene regulatory patterns in Huntington's Disease using
    allele-specific expression.
  Abstract: Huntington’s disease (HD) is a monogenic neurodegenerative disorder caused
    by an expanded CAG repeat in the HTT gene, leading to cognitive decline, motor
    dysfunction, and eventual dementia. Although disease etiology is consistent, variability
    in age of onset and progression is influenced by CAG repeat length and transcriptional
    regulation. This study explores cis-regulatory variation in HD using a network-based
    stratification approach to allele-specific expression (ASE) data.We analyzed RNA-seq
    data from postmortem prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 9) samples of 20 HD patients
    (GSE64810). Variant calling and read counting were performed using GATK, followed
    by ASE analysis. Patients were stratified into clusters based on allelic imbalance
    profiles using pyNBS, integrating functional gene relationships. Differential
    ASE and gene expression analysis identified significantly dysregulated genes,
    further analyzed through Gene Ontology enrichment and network extension using
    DisGeNET and STRINGdb.Two distinct patient clusters emerged, highlighting transcriptional
    heterogeneity in HD. Among 71 differentially expressed and imbalanced genes, six
    (KRAS, CACNA1B, MBP, COX4I1, CAMK2G, DLL1) showed strong connections to HD-related
    pathways and neurological disorders. Notably, MBP expression, associated with
    early HD onset in mice, suggests its role as a modifier gene. These findings demonstrate
    ASE's utility in uncovering transcriptional regulators underlying HD heterogeneity,
    complementing traditional approaches.

  Talk title: Cross-feeding Creates Tipping Points in Microbiome Diversity
  Abstract: How the extraordinary diversity of microbiomes emerges from the interactions
    between individual populations is a important unanswered question in microbial
    ecology. Key to this process are the cross-feeding networks that structure these
    systems in which populations release metabolic by-products into the environment
    for other members of the community to use. Understanding how cross-feeding contributes
    to coexistence presents a major challenge due to the complex structure of cross-feeding
    networks and the interdependencies they create between populations. In this work
    we address this problem by using the tools of network science to develop and analyse
    a structural model of microbial community cross-feeding (Fig. 1A). Our model represents
    the community as a bipartite- or hypergraph in which consumers and resources are
    linked by the consumption and secretion of metabolites. We consider feasible community
    states by introducing simple rules that determine the presence of consumers and
    resources. Using percolation theory and the generating function formalism we derive
    expressions for the realised diversity of consumers and metabolites in cross-feeding
    networks with arbitrary degree distributions. We apply our model to random networks
    where we find tipping points at which community diversity abruptly changes in
    response to changes in network structure (Fig 1B \& C). These points correspond
    to discontinuous percolation transitions and occur due to the collapse and reassembly
    of the active cross-feeding network. We also consider how robust these cross-feeding
    networks are to attack, deriving expressions for the state of the community following
    the removal of consumers and resources from the system.

  Talk title: The impact of mutations on protein multiscale structure through persistent
    homology
  Abstract: Protein function and structure are tightly linked. Proteins have a multiscale
    structure characterised by complex interactions and substructures that unfold
    across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. The coupling across scales
    means that local mutations can lead to global changes in structure and function.
    Here, we present a computationally efficient framework that uses graph representations
    of protein structures and integrates multiscale community detection, using Markov
    Stability (MS), with topological data analysis (TDA), through the Multiscale Clustering
    Filtration (MCF), to analyse the impact of mutations by measuring the changes
    they induce in the full multiscale structure of proteins. Our MS+MCF workflow
    is based on constructing atomistic energy-weighted graphs of proteins from their
    3D structures. These graphs are built for the wildtype (WT) as well as for point
    mutations generated using FoldX. We capture the robustness of partitions at a
    given scale with the average Normalised Variation of Information (NVI) and the
    level of hierarchy in the sequence of partitions through the persistent hierarchy.
    We demonstrate the application of MS+MCF to the closed conformation of adenylate
    kinase (AdK). We find that mutations known to disrupt protein dynamics and function
    show significant deviations in NVI compared to the WT, whereas non-disruptive
    mutations align closely with the WT. Furthermore, the analysis of the persistent
    hierarchy shows that mutations with significant functional impact induce abrupt
    jumps at specific characteristic scales. Analysing protein graphs with MS+MCF
    enables us to detect the structural and dynamical impacts of mutations by measuring
    the disruption in hierarchical domain organisation and higher-order interactions
    that govern the multiscale architecture of the protein.

  Talk title: Mining higher-order triadic interactions in gene-expression data
  Abstract: Higher-order networks are attracting  large scientific interest in recent
    years. However, a key challenge is to infer higher-order interactions from data.
    Triadic interactions are a fundamental type of higher-order interactions that
    occur when one node regulates the interaction between two other nodes. Triadic
    interactions are known to be key in ecosystems, in neuronal networks, and in gene
    regulation networks. However, information theory approaches to mine triadic interactions
    are still lacking. In this work we explore the fundamental dynamical properties
    of networks with triadic interactions between continuous variables.We formulate
    a general model of networks with triadic interactions. Moreover  we propose an
    information theory framework and an algorithm, validated on the triadic model,
    that we call Triaction, that  is able to mine triadic interactions from data.This
    algorithm is applied on synthetic data as well as Acute Myeloid Leukemia gene
    expression data finding new candidates for triadic interactions as well as validating
    already established biological results.In conclusion, our work proposes a new
    information theoretic approach to mine triadic interactions. In the future, the
    method could be applied to other types of data including structured missingness.

  Talk title: More dominant baboons have less and lower quality sleep
  Abstract: The amount and quality of sleep individuals get can impact various aspects
    of human and non-human animal health,ultimately affecting fitness. For wild animals
    that sleep in groups, individuals may disturb one another, influencing sleepquality
    and quantity [1, 2], but this aspect of social sleep has been understudied due
    to methodological challenges. Bycombining longitudinal accelerometer data and
    tools from network science, we investigate the social dimension of sleepin a wild
    troop of baboons (Papio ursinus). We test the hypothesis that individual’s social
    dominance can affect sleepopportunities by explaining sleep patterns as a function
    of baboons’ hierarchical social structure. First, we show thatthe troop’s night-time
    sleep (determined by 40Hz acceleration data) is highly synchronized. By modeling
    sleep as aMarkov chain (Fig 1A), we show that similarly ranked baboons are more
    synchronized (Fig 1B), and unexpectedly, moredominant baboons experience less
    and lower-quality sleep. Next, we link night-time sleep dynamics to daytime spatialproximity
    networks, which we use as proxy for social relationships. We propose that the
    hierarchy effect is explained byhigher-ranked baboons resting closer to more group
    members. This is further endorsed through the analysis of a crosscorrelationnetwork
    (Fig 1C), where dominant individuals exert greater influence on each other’s night-time
    behaviourcompared to lower-ranked individuals. Our study provides the first empirical
    evidence for the impact of social hierarchieson sleep in a wild primate, suggesting
    that dominance status may impose trade-offs between social rank and the qualityand
    quantity of sleep.

  Talk title: 'Human Reference Atlas: Multiscale Networks and Knowledge Graphs'
  Abstract: 'The HuBMAP Human Reference Atlas (HRA) effort [1-3] aims to develop a
    common coordinate framework (CCF) for the healthy human body, see HRA Portal at
    https://humanatlas.io. An international team of 1000+ organ experts (anatomists,
    pathologist, surgeons, biomedical researchers) and ontologists across 20+ consortia
    are authoring anatomical structures, cell types, and biomarkers (ASCT+B) tables
    that capture partonomy and typology information of core entities in the human
    body. The ASCT+B tables are used to revise and extend existing CCF-relevant ontologies.
    In close collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
    (NIAID), a 3D Reference Object Library was compiled (https://3d.nih.gov/collections/hra)
    that provides semantically annotated 3D representations of major anatomical structures
    (see samples in Fig. 1) captured in the ASCT+B tables. The HRA can be extended
    and explored using several interactive user interfaces: The Registration User
    Interface (RUI, https://apps.humanatlas.io/rui) supports tissue data registration
    and annotation across 50+ 3D reference organs. The Exploration User Interface
    (EUI, https://apps.humanatlas.io/eui) supports exploration of semantically and
    spatially explicit data—from the whole body to the single cell level. The Cell
    Distance Explorer (CDE, https://apps.humanatlas.io/cde) computes and visualizes
    distance distributions between different cells, cell types, and anatomical structures
    and cell types and morphological features. For an introduction to HuBMAP and HRA
    goals, data, and code visit the Visible Human MOOC (VHMOOC, https://expand.iu.edu/browse/sice/cns/courses/hubmap-visible-human-mooc).
    This talk details the multi-modal, multi-scale networks of the HRA, how HRA data
    is published as an open knowledge graph [4] (https://humanatlas.io/api), and how
    HuBMAP, SenNet, GTEx, and other tissue data is mapped to the HRA to harmonize
    data at scale in support of precision health and medicine [3].'

  Talk title: 'Measuring plasticity: a network-based approach to anticipate transitions
    in mental health'
  Abstract: The seminal works by Denny Borsboom on the network theory of psychopathology,
    proposing to conceptualize mental disorders as networks of symptoms [1], have
    been among the most innovative scientific ideas in the mental health field. Building
    on this theoretical framework, the network theory of plasticity has been recently
    introduced [2, 3]. This theory proposes the connectivity strength among the elements
    of a system as a measure of system plasticity and thus of its ability to change
    its outcome. In particular, the weaker the connectivity, the higher the plasticity
    of the system. When conceptualizing an individual as a network of interconnected
    symptoms, the individual’s plasticity -- and thus their ability to transition
    from psychopathology to wellbeing -- is predicted to be inversely related to the
    connectivity strength (i.e., the degree of positive or negative co-occurrence)
    among the symptoms such as the nine standard symptoms for major depressive disorder
    measured according to DSM-5. The validity of this operationalization has been
    recently demonstrated. Findings revealed that the baseline connectivity strength
    among symptoms inversely correlates with subsequent improvement over four weeks
    (ρ = –0.88, P = 0.002) and is significantly weaker in responders than in non-responders
    to treatment (P = 0.004) [4]. Furthermore, the operationalization of plasticity
    significantly differentiated individuals based on their recovery timelines according
    to the principle that higher plasticity (i.e., weaker connectivity) enables faster
    transitions to wellbeing and vice versa [5]. Notably, these outcomes hold particular
    significance for patients with a favorable quality of life, as high plasticity
    facilitates mental state changes in response to contextual factors [2]. This framework
    offers a novel mathematical tool to measure plasticity, likely generalizable across
    levels of analysis and research fields.
