  Talk title: Topological autocorrelation in multiscale clusterings via 2-parameter
    persistent homology
  Abstract: In many areas of data science, networks have an intrinsic multiscale structure,
    whereby meaningful descriptions exist at different levels of coarseness (or scales).
    In such cases, it is desirable to go beyond clustering into a single partition
    to find a (not necessarily hierarchical) sequence of partitions that captures
    aspects of the data at multiple levels of resolution. A natural problem is then
    to analyse and characterise such sequences of coarsening multiscale clusterings.
    To enhance the interpretability for multiscale clusterings, we use multi-parameter
    persistent homology (MPH) and introduce a 2-parameter filtration of abstract simplicial
    complexes, termed Multiscale Clustering Bifiltration (MCbiF). The MCbiF captures
    the “topological autocorrelation” of the history-dependent, non-stationary sequence
    of non-hierarchical, coarsening partitions, and leads to rich algebraic invariants
    like the 0- and 1-dimensional Hilbert functions. We illustrate the MCbiF with
    an application to ensembles of graphs sampled stochastic block models with different
    planted partition structure and find that our method both captures the hierarchy
    of the models and recovers the ground-truth scales as “conflict-resolving” partitions.
    To our knowledge, MCbiF is the first application of multiparameter persistence
    to analyse multiscale networks. By disentangling the “aggregation history”  in
    multiscale clusterings, MCbiF provides enhanced sensitivity and robustness to
    characterise the higher-order interactions in non-hierarchical sequences of partitions.

  Talk title: Destination Prediction in Higher-Order Networks using Endpoint-Conditioned
    Markov Chains
  Abstract: Transportation systems are designed to address daily mobility needs, making
    origin-destination demand a foundational concept in planning and operations. To
    better represent and analyze these inherently nonlinear and self-evolving systems,
    network models grounded in graph theory have been broadly employed. Recently,
    with the increasing availability of path-based data, such as GPS trajectories,
    higher-order network models have emerged as a powerful framework for capturing
    memory effects in complex systems, leveraging dependencies across multiple prior
    states to improve the accuracy of sequential predictions. Despite their advantages
    in modeling these dependencies, higher-order networks often encounter limitations
    in accurately predicting destinations, which is critical for enhancing the control
    and optimization of transportation systems. To address this challenge, we propose
    an innovative framework that combines the sequential modeling strengths of higher-order
    networks with the contextual constraints introduced through endpoint-conditional
    Markov chains, providing an efficient and effective solution for improved destination
    prediction in transportation systems.

  Talk title: 'Assessment of High-Order Interactions in Dynamic Networks: An Approach
    based on Conditional Information Rates'
  Abstract: The traditional approach to network representation in complex systems
    focuses primarily on quantifying the connections between pairs of system units.
    However, higher-order interactions (HOIs), involving three or more units, often
    play a critical role in shaping the collective behavior of the network. A commonly
    used metric for quantifying HOIs is the Interaction Information Rate (IIR), which
    can be positive (indicating redundancy) or negative (indicating synergy). As network
    size grows, the number of possible node combinations increases exponentially,
    creating significant computational challenges and making analysis more resource
    intensive. To address this issue, an iterative approach is proposed to identify
    subsets of network processes that form the most redundant or synergistic multiplets
    relative to a predefined target process. The method begins by identifying the
    most redundant or synergistic triplet—including the target process—using the IIR.
    At each subsequent step, a new process is selected from the remaining network
    processes (excluding those in the initial triplet) by maximizing or minimizing
    a cost function based on conditional IIR. In each step, the statistical significance
    of the conditional IIR value is assessed using the Iterative Amplitude Adjusted
    Fourier Transform. If the value is statistically significant, the process is added
    to the subset; otherwise, the procedure stops, and the previous subset is retained.
    The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated through an illustrative simulation
    of a network of coupled Gaussian processes.

  Talk title: Higher-Order Network Effects on Information Access Equality & Efficiency
  Abstract: Early access to important information such as job opportunities and emergent
    threats can provide large advantages to the person receiving the information.
    If groups are systematically disadvantaged in their access to time-critical information,
    existing socioeconomic inequalities can be perpetuated and exacerbated. While
    information spreading on graphs and higher-order structures has been studied extensively,
    the effects of the interplay between homophily and higher-order interactions on
    time-critical information access remain poorly understood. Here, we study how
    homophily and asymmetric transmission mechanisms influence fair access to information
    in social systems. We introduce a maximum entropy model of hypergraphs with two
    node groups in which connections are formed according to degree distribution and
    edge-size-dependent homophily patterns. We use a stochastic, compartmental model
    with group-specific transmission rates and non-linearity to model information
    spread on synthetic and real-world hypergraphs. To quantify fairness in information
    access, we introduce a new measure based on optimal transport and supplement our
    analysis with several existing ones. We then leverage our insights to design interventions
    that increase fairness. Overall, we find that the influence of hypergraph homophily
    patterns and dynamics parameters are tightly intertwined. Inequality is largest
    in high homophily scenarios that favor in-group transmission but persists under
    symmetric transmission. Further, the presence of mixed homophily patterns improves
    the equality of information access. Real-world hypergraphs exhibit qualitatively
    similar patterns. Based on these results, we explore the efficacy of adjusting
    contagion parameters and restructuring the hypergraph to improve information access
    equality. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding the interplay
    of higher-order interactions and homophily to quantify and combat inequality in
    access to time-critical information.

  Talk title: Dynamical Fluctuations of Random Walks in Higher-Order Networks
  Abstract: Although higher-order interactions are known to affect the typical state
    of dynamical processes giving rise to new collective behavior, how they drive
    the emergence of rare events and fluctuations is still an open problem. We investigate
    how fluctuations of a dynamical quantity of a random walk exploring a higher-order
    network arise over time. In the quenched case, where the hypergraph structure
    is fixed, through large deviation theory we show that the appearance of rare events
    is hampered in nodes with many higher-order interactions, and promoted elsewhere.
    Dynamical fluctuations are further boosted in an annealed scenario, where both
    the diffusion process and higher-order interactions evolve in time. Here, extreme
    fluctuations generated by optimal higher-order configurations can be predicted
    in the limit of a saddle-point approximation. Our study lays the groundwork for
    a wide and general theory of fluctuations and rare events in higher-order networks.

  Talk title: Efficient sampling from the hypergraph configuration model
  Abstract: 'Many empirical complex systems such as social interactions, email networks,
    chemical reaction networks, and co-authorship networks contain interactions of
    arbitrary size, known as higher-order interactions. In contrast to pairwise networks
    which model all interactions as dyadic, hypergraphs are a natural modeling choice
    for representing group interactions. The hypergraph configuration model is a random
    model for generating synthetic hypergraphs with degree and edge-size heterogeneity
    and is completely specified by the sequence of nodal degrees and interaction sizes
    [1]. The predominant method for sampling these networks is starting from an empirical
    network or constructed network and performing network operations such as double-edge
    swaps to explore the space of possible networks.A critical shortcoming, however,
    is the lack of heuristics or tests proving that the sampled hypergraph is sufficiently
    close to being drawn from the configuration model. We present two advances that
    make sampling from the hypergraph configuration model more robust: (1) we present
    conditions for using the heuristic presented in Ref. [2] for constructing a non-loopy
    hypergraph from degree and edge-size sequences fails, and (2) we calculate the
    burn-in time and sampling gap for and ensemble of empirical hypergraphs and use
    these calculations to derive heuristics for their values, similar to those calculated
    in Ref. [3].These advances allow us to, for the first time, (1) predict compatible
    parameters for power-law degree and edge size distributions and (2) empirically
    simulate contagion processes on configuration model hypergraphs with exact degrees
    and edge sizes. Our results provide important guidance for higher-order network
    scientists simulating dynamical processes on heterogeneous higher-order networks.'

  Talk title: Exploring the Non-uniqueness of Hypergraph Adjacency Matrices
  Abstract: Hypergraphs are a common representation for network data featuring group
    interactions. Researchers sometimes simplify hypergraph data by projecting it
    back onto the set of nodes, constructing undirected multigraphs where a link is
    placed between two nodes for each hyperedge they share. This co-occurence projection,
    sometimes called the hypergraph adjacency matrix, is convenient because it facilitates
    the generalization of pairwise network methods of analysis to hypergraphs. However,
    it is known that the hypergraph adjacency matrix is not unique to a single hypergraph
    and that non-isomorphic hypergraphs with the same adjacency matrix can exhibit
    different dynamical behaviors. In this work, we explore the non-uniqueness of
    hypergraph adjacency matrices numerically by providing an algorithm to enumerate
    the isomorphism classes of hypergraphs that correspond to a given hypergraph adjacency
    matrix. Here we show results for simple 3-uniform hypergraphs on 6 nodes, whch
    can be fully enumerated, as well as approaches for finding results on larger and
    more complex configurations via random sampling.

  Talk title: Higher-order similarity measures for hypergraphs comparison
  Abstract: 'Higher-order networks have attracted significant interest for their capacity
    to model systems beyond pairwise interactions, offering a more flexible and comprehensive
    framework than traditional networks. A critical challenge in applying these structures
    to complex systems is devising effective methods to measure their similarities.
    While several similarity measures exist for pairwise networks, dedicated approaches
    for higher-order ones remain scarce. To fill this gap, we propose two hypergraph
    similarity measures: Hyper NetSimile and Hyperedge-Portrait Divergence, which
    extend existing methodologies to higher-order structures. First, we demonstrate
    the necessity of higher-order measures by conidering a scenario in which pairwise
    measures would fail by definition. Then, we show that our methods effectively
    group hypergraph models based on their generative mechanisms, as structures created
    by the same process exhibit greater similarity. The measures we propose, derived
    from a principled generalization of pairwise counter-parts, provide thus valuable
    tools for assessing similarity between hypergraphs.'
