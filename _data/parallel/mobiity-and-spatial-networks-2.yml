  Talk title: Inferential clustering reveals administrative boundaries in Austrian
    migration networks
  Abstract: Migration drives urbanization, segregation, and socioeconomic change,
    yet internal migration remains underexplored compared to international migration.
    Modeling human mobility as networks, where nodes represent geographic regions
    and edges capture migration flows, enables the use of community detection methods
    to reveal structural patterns.Using Austria’s 2021 internal migration data, we
    applied the weighted Stochastic Block Model to uncover the modular structure of
    migration flows. Detected communities closely align with administrative boundaries,
    a novel finding validated through comparison with gravity model-based synthetic
    networks. These results suggest that administrative divisions significantly influence
    migration patterns beyond what mechanistic models predict.Extending this analysis
    to other countries, we find varying degrees of alignment, indicating context-dependent
    relationships between migration flows and administrative structures. This study
    emphasizes the value of advanced network methods in understanding internal migration
    dynamics.

  Talk title: Unsupervised Embedding of Mobility Networks Reveals Invisible Barriers
    in US Cities
  Abstract: Borders are prevalent in cities, conditioning mobility and shaping people's
    experience and sometimes aggravate social inequality through segregation. Past
    studies of mobility borders are limited to qualitative observations, anecdotal
    evidence, or static census data, providing only partial insights into how individuals
    navigate and experience the city through movement across different regions. In
    this work, we apply the unsupervised embedding method, specifically the skip-gram
    word2vec model towards human trajectory data to fill this gap. The dense representations
    of locations learned from word2vec model surpass traditional geographical metrics,
    revealing how demographic factors such as income influence urban connectivity.
    This approach allows us to identify 'borders' and 'bridges' that shape human mobility
    patterns, offering insights into the complex interplay between geographical and
    non-geographical factors. Our findings underscore the potential of data-driven
    methods to inform more inclusive urban planning and policy-making, highlighting
    the importance of considering both visible and invisible barriers in understanding
    the spatial dynamics of urban environments.

  Talk title: Spanish heat waves curb discretionary mobility and alter work behavior
    among the elderly
  Abstract: Extreme heat is a growing problem in European countries with rising temperatures
    and aging populations especially vulnerable to them. Research documents the consequences
    of high temperatures for economic growth and public health, but the effect of
    heat on the activities and behaviors that contribute to these consequences is
    less clear; with greater understanding of how populations react to heat waves,
    we can target policies to harden society against rising temperatures. Using rich
    mobility data that allows us to stratify according to age, gender, class and the
    type of activity, here we explore the consequences of extreme heat for mobility
    in Spain. Activity falls by as much as 8% on hot days and as much as 20% on hot
    afternoons, when temperatures are highest. People are less likely to forego frequent,
    routine activities relative to infrequent ones—and least likely to miss work.
    We identify significant differences across groups and activities, with the oldest
    most likely to avoid travel to work while cutting back most on other activities
    and the poorest are least likely to avoid travel to work—perhaps because they
    are least able to afford missing it, or perhaps because they are least able to
    work from home. Our results highlight the complex ways heat influences mobility
    and suggests hidden costs, from decreased foot traffic for restaurants to increased
    exposure to deleterious conditions for workers.

  Talk title: A network study of road mobility in the Roman Empire
  Abstract: This study presents the first network analysis of a spatially detailed
    model of Roman roads, based on the most comprehensive and granular dataset to
    date (Brughmans et al., 2024). At its peak, the Roman Empire spanned more than
    5 million km^2 across Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, supported by
    an extensive transportation network that facilitated commerce, communication,
    and military operations. Although rivers and seas provided efficient long-distance
    transport, roads were essential for connecting inland areas and enabling effective
    short- to mid-distance travel.We model the Empire's road networks, as well as
    those of individual Roman provinces, as spatial graphs, with nodes corresponding
    to settlements or road intersections and edges representing road segments. We
    perform an exploratory network analysis. Roads are revealed to have low sinuosity
    in general, supporting the long-held assumption that Roman roads were relatively
    straight. The networks have small clustering coefficient, and vary in density
    from region to region, with the Empire overall including 46% of the theoretically
    possible road segments  (gamma index).We then estimate interurban traffic, a key
    component of overall road use, using spatial interaction models, integrating settlement
    population estimates with travel time estimates based on road length and terrain
    slope (Fig.~1a). The models estimate higher traffic flows on road segments identified
    by archaeologists as historically significant. These findings remain robust even
    after the removal of up to 30\% of road segments classified as uncertain in the
    archaeological literature (Fig.~1b). These insights into the structure of past
    terrestrial mobility in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East demonstrate
    the effectiveness of network-based approaches in revealing Roman transportation
    dynamics and are crucial for understanding the long-term development of mobility
    in the area.

  Talk title: Quantifying link importance and synergies in infrastructure networks
  Abstract: Infrastructure networks are crucial for enabling human mobility across
    almost all modes of transport. However, designing efficient transport networks
    is a complex problem due to the mutual dependencies between the structure and
    usage of the network. For example, improving one link in the network may alter
    route choices of travelers and thereby also affect the usage and importance of
    all other links. Understanding the synergies and the importance of individual
    links is a fundamental prerequisite for efficient network extension planning.
    Common route choice models, however, are often not well suited to this task. Shortest
    path routing typically oversimplifies route choices and discrete choice models
    require predefined routing options, not suitable for network planning tasks where
    efficient routing options vary over time. Here, we analytically quantify the importance
    of individual links and the synergy of multiple links in transport networks by
    exploiting a recently proposed perturbed utility route choice model based on optimal
    flow assignment. By describing the route changes in response to the improvement
    of individual links as cycle flows in the network, we analytically track the optimal
    flow solution and the changes in overall network quality. This enables us to directly
    quantify the importance of individual links as the derivative of the total network
    quality with respect to the change in link quality. Additionally, higher order
    derivatives capture synergies between different links in the network. We apply
    this approach to bike path network planning and demonstrate potential applications
    to automatically generate efficient prioritization of bike path network extensions
    and identify synergistic corridors for bike highways in urban street networks.Our
    results may help to improve the quantitative evaluation of complex interactions
    and synergies in transport and infrastructure networks and support efficient network
    extension planning.

  Talk title: Probabilistic Model for Shortest Path Distances and Shortest Path Field
    in Random Spatial Networks
  Abstract: Random Spatial Networks (RSNs), including Random Geometric Graphs (RGG),
    Soft RGG, and Gabriel Graphs, model systems embedded in physical space such as
    communication and transportation networks. A fundamental challenge in RSNs is
    understanding shortest path distances, which are crucial for optimizing routing
    and analyzing network robustness.This study develops a probabilistic framework
    for shortest path distances in RSNs. Using the Central Limit Theorem, we show
    that the Euclidean distances of nodes at a shortest path distance t from a given
    node u follow a normal distribution, N(μ_t, σ_t), with both μ_t and σ_t^2 growing
    linearly with t. Explicit formulas for these parameters are provided for RGGs.
    We establish a relationship between Euclidean and shortest path distances, enabling
    computation of the probability:Pr[dist(u, v) = t | |u - v|] = Φ((|u - v| - μ_{t-1})
    / σ_{t-1}) - Φ((|u - v| - μ_t) / σ_t),where Φ(x) is the cumulative distribution
    function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution.Additionally, leveraging the
    probabilistic relationship between shortest path components, we propose a shortest
    path field model that predicts shortest path node distributions. This model, validated
    through simulations, demonstrates high accuracy in RSNs with high average degree.
