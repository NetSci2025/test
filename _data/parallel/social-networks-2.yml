  Talk title: Social transmission along multiple pathways promotes information fidelity
    and reduces divisiveness
  Abstract: 'As people increasingly turn to online platforms for learning and information
    exchange, understanding how information is transformed through repeated transmission
    is essential for predicting collective outcomes and mitigating misinformation.
    Research on social learning and collective cognition highlights that the validity
    of information received by individuals is strongly influenced by the pathways
    through which it travels. While stories passed through many individuals often
    become distorted, information cross-checked against multiple references at various
    stages tends to be more accurate.In a novel, large-scale preregistered behavioral
    experiment, we demonstrate that the structural features of social networks significantly
    impact the fidelity and divisiveness of transmitted information. Participants
    (n=864) read and reproduced a seed text about the history and risks of antibiotics
    under two experimental conditions: a single-pathway network, where information
    flowed linearly, and a multiple-pathway network, where information was redundantly
    transmitted through three pathways (Fig. 1A–B).Our findings show that even minimal
    structural redundancy can enhance information fidelity and promote consensus in
    the retelling of a scientific text. Specifically, transmission in multiple-pathway
    networks (i) reduces information loss as texts propagate between participants
    (Fig. 1C), and (ii) promotes consensus on information content among non-interacting
    participants in independently tested networks (Fig. 1D).To further understand
    these patterns, we developed a simple computational model grounded in prior research
    on social learning. This model provides a mechanistic explanation of how redundancy
    influences information transmission. Simulations using the model qualitatively
    replicate the experimental results (Fig. 1D). Finally, exploratory analyses reveal
    that redundancy amplifies the transmission of emotional content, particularly
    fear-related information.'

  Talk title: 'From Framework to Insights: The Role of Priority Users in Echo Chamber
    Formation'
  Abstract: We present a Python library for simulating an opinion model that abstracts
    the communication dynamics within a social media platform called DOCES (Dynamical
    Opinion Clusters Exploration Suite). Its core functions are implemented in CPython
    to achieve C performance. In this model, agents have continuous opinions with
    values between -1 and 1. The agents can share external content in the social network,
    simulating real-world observations. In addition, they can re-post information
    based on their feed. A social network's recommendation algorithm governs the reception
    of content by peers. Agents then adjust their opinions based on the content they
    receive. Disagreements in opinions can lead to changes in friendships. Each step
    is governed by probabilistic filters that take user opinions into account. In
    addition to its configurations, DOCES allows the measurement of several outputs
    of the dynamics, including the resulting network structure and the opinions of
    the users. We used DOCES to study the effects of changing the verification policy
    on X, which is called X Premium. We set up DOCES to mimic the behavior of the
    algorithm for verified users, henceforth called priority users. We adapted the
    model so that priority users always have their posts delivered to their followers.
    We found that the echo chambers weaken by increasing the number of priority users.
    We also tested the possibility of extremists taking advantage of verified accounts.
    We named them as ideologues. In this case, we set half to opinion -1 and the other
    half to 1. We found that the priority accounts can significantly amplify the echo
    chambers. We also varied the percentage of priority users and ideologues. As expected,
    the echo chambers tend to weaken as the number of priority users increases. Surprisingly,
    though, the echo chambers are amplified after sufficient ideologues are added,
    showing that a few percent can make a difference.

  Talk title: 'Political Polarization Patterns on Bluesky: Understanding Political
    Discussion in an Emerging Social Platform'
  Abstract: 'Political polarization has become an increasingly concerning societal
    phenomenon in recent years, with far-reachingimplications for democratic discourse,
    policy making and social cohesion. As traditional public squares have given wayto
    digital arenas, social media platforms have emerged as primary venues for political
    debate and opinion formation.However, the impact of these digital spaces on polarization
    dynamics remains a subject of ongoing research and debate.This raises fundamental
    questions about the nature of online political discourse: Are all digital spaces
    where politicaldiscussion takes place destined to become hierarchical, politically
    divided, and develop echo chambers?While much attention has focused on major social
    media platforms, new digital spaces are emerging that not onlyshow potential for
    fostering less toxic environments but are also built on decentralized architecture.
    This study contributesto the growing body of knowledge on social media polarization
    by examining Bluesky, a relatively new platform. Ourresearch measures both structural
    [1] and affective [2] polarization within the Bluesky ecosystem. We analyze three
    keyaspects of each selected political communication network, which represents
    a prominent topic of discussion within theplatform: group structure through stochastic
    block models, issue-based polarization with the adaptive EI-index, and issuealignment
    using normalized mutual information. Through this analysis, we address the following
    questions: 1) To whatextent does polarization exist on Bluesky, and what distinct
    polarized groups emerge? 2) What are the dominant topicsof discussion on Bluesky,
    and which topics show the highest levels of polarization? 3) How do these patterns
    compare topreviously observed polarization on similar platforms?The full abstract
    is in the attached PDF.'

  Talk title: Characterizing the Fragmentation of the Social Media Ecosystem
  Abstract: 'The entertainment-driven dynamics of social media platforms encourage
    users to engage with like-minded individuals and consume content aligned with
    their beliefs.These dynamics may amplify polarization by reinforcing shared perspectives
    and reducing exposure to diverse viewpoints.Simultaneously, users migrate from
    one platform to another, either forced by moderation policies, such as de-platforming,
    or spontaneously seeking environments more aligned with their preferences. These
    migrations foster the specialization and differentiation of the social media ecosystem,
    with platforms increasingly organized around specific user communities and shared
    content preferences. This shift marks an evolution from echo chambers enclosed
    within platforms to "echo platforms", i.e., entire platforms functioning as ideologically
    homogeneous niches. This study introduces an operational framework to systematically
    analyze these dynamics, by examining three key dimensions: platform centrality
    (central vs. peripheral), news consumption (reliable vs questionable), and user
    base composition (uniform vs diverse). To this aim, we leverage a dataset of 126M
    URLs posted by nearly 6M users on nine social media platforms, namely Facebook,
    Reddit, Twitter (now X), YouTube, BitChute, Gab, Parler, Scored, and Voat. We
    model traffic between the nine platforms, and between platform and external domains,
    using weighted directed networks, and utilize apt null models to account for platforms''
    size disparity when needed.  We find a clear separation between mainstream and
    alt-tech platforms, with the second category being characterized by a peripheral
    role in the social media ecosystem, a greater prevalence of unreliable content,
    and a heightened ideological uniformity. These findings outline the main dimensions
    defining the fragmentation and polarization of the social media ecosystem.'

  Talk title: Humans and AI imagining social networks from a distance
  Abstract: A tenet of the last century of social science is that the wiring of social
    networks explains their function. It has been argued that people are not merely
    passively affected by their positions in social networks—instead, we try to exploit
    and improve our network positions. Artificially intelligent agents entering a
    world of humans—either as commercial applications viaexperiments in the social
    and behavioral sciences—need a sense of how humans operate theirsocial networks.
    But do they have it yet? In this work, we challenge LLMs and humans to imagine
    the social structures observed in three classical social network studies.Our findings
    reveal that humans show a marginally better understanding of social networks than
    the LLMs of 2024; at least in the third-person perspective that we investigate.
    On the other hand, even humans perform poorly, like the AI putting too much emphasis
    on external information (like corporate structure). Some interesting details are
    emerging, like how poorly both humans and machines predict the average degree
    and that humans don’t overestimate the managers asking their subordinates for
    advice or calling them friends.The difficulty of this task raises questions about
    AI's ability to replicate human social intuition. Could human sociality, deeply
    ingrained through evolution, provide an edge over machines? Maybe human sociality,
    and thus social network understanding, is hardcoded in our genes giving us an
    edge over the machines. Still, the LLMs have presumably been trained on a vast
    amount of literature about social networks, and could for that reason be expected
    to perform as well as people.The main question remaining, and an avenue for future
    research is if changing the perspective to the first person also changes the performance
    of both humans and machines. We have high hopes for the future of AIs as a tool
    to understand humans, but that will require us to know that AIs can predict and
    respond to human behavior close to perfectly.

  Talk title: 'Political alliances across relational contexts: a complex coalition
    approach'
  Abstract: Coalitions are social mechanisms for political actors to organise joint
    action for mutual gain. As coalitions drive collective action across political
    phenomena--including government formation, international relations, and public
    policy--understanding how they emerge and contribute to diverse outcomes, such
    as perceptions of political opponents, policy gridlocks, or even reshuffling of
    the global order is core to the study of politics. However, exactly how to conceptualise
    and operationalise coalitions has been challenging.Here, we introduce the complex
    coalition approach. It emphasises the notion of the relatively local social ties
    among political actors giving rise to political alliances. However, such emergent
    coalitions unfold not only within, but across various relational contexts, which
    provide actors with varying affordances to engage with each other and advance
    their goals. To accommodate these ideas under a single, statistically rigorous,
    and generalisable framework, we build on layered political networks and inferential
    network partitioning techniques to model the structure and dynamics of coalitions
    across spatially and temporally dependent relational contexts.To demonstrate the
    application and merits of our approach, we study coalition emergence in Finnish
    climate politics, focusing on formal collaboration, media discourse, and online
    endorsement among a hundred political organisations, both before and after the
    Paris Agreement. Specifically, we show how a 14-layer model that appropriately
    accounts for cross-context dependencies yields a substantially smaller description
    length (i.e., requires less information to describe the data) than a model that
    considers each of these relational contexts in isolation, suggesting that cross-context
    dependencies contribute substantial explanatory power to coalition emergence.

  Talk title: Patterns of partisan toxicity and engagement reveal the common structure
    of online political communication across countries
  Abstract: Existing studies of political polarization are often limited to a single
    country and one form of polarization, hindering a comprehensive understanding
    of the phenomenon. Here we investigate patterns of polarization online across
    nine countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, Turkey, UK, USA),
    focusing on the structure of political interaction networks, the use of toxic
    language targeting out-groups, and how these factors relate to user engagement.
    First, we show that political interaction networks are structurally polarized
    on Twitter (currently X; see Figure 1). Second, we reveal that out-group interactions,
    defined by the network, are more toxic than in-group interactions, indicative
    of affective polarization. Third, we show that out-group interactions receive
    lower engagement than in-group interactions. Finally, we identify a common ally-enemy
    structure in political interactions, show that political mentions are more toxic
    than apolitical mentions, and highlight that interactions between politically
    engaged accounts are limited and rarely reciprocated. These results hold across
    countries and represent a step towards a stronger cross-country understanding
    of polarization.
