  Talk title: Placement of monitoring sites on a wastewater network for effective
    disease surveillance
  Abstract: Wastewater-based epidemiology (WWBE) emerged as a method for monitoring
    infectious diseases SARS-COV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic [1]. One strength
    of WWBE is that diseases can be monitored passively over entire populations, removing
    demographic biases due to, for example, reporting behaviour, but introducing challenges
    due to multiple sources of variation associated with signal detection. A key issue
    is the intersection between two complex networks – mobility networks spreading
    the disease, and the network of sewage pipes accumulating virus (Figure 1).  Here,
    we develop an algorithm for choosing where to place a limited number of monitoring
    sites, given the overall structure of the wastewater network and the distribution
    of residents on that network, and test this method against a set of real wastewater
    systems, where the aim is to either quickly detect a novel disease outbreak or
    target containment measures, or both. We simulate disease surveillance in sewer
    catchment areas containing up to half a million residents and compare it to (i)
    COVID-19 case data distributions and (ii) simulations where infection is driven
    by recorded mobility networks and spatial proximity. We quantify the tradeoffs
    in spatial and temporal resolution associated with having only a limited sampling
    capacity (e.g. is it better to test 2x per week in a single location, or 1x per
    week at two?). We show that our placement of monitoring sites further "upstream"
    substantially outperforms simple monitoring at the "sink" as well as random placement,
    by more quickly and precisely detecting infected individuals which may otherwise
    fall under the threshold for detection at the "sink" node. We then use a previous
    approach [2] to quantify the sensitivity and specificity that our approach has
    to detect incidence patterns as COVID-19 burdens rise and fall. [1] Fitzgerald

  Talk title: Disease-induced immunization is efficient in dense geometric networks
  Abstract: Herd immunity depends heavily on the structure of contact networks, and
    also on the mechanism through which individuals have gained immunity. Extending
    the work of Hiraoka et al. (2024), here we demonstrate that the average degree
    in geometric networks plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of vaccine- and
    disease-induced immunization strategies. Our results show that vaccine-induced
    immunity is more effective in sparse, moderately degree-heterogeneous networks.
    However, as the edge density increases, disease-induced immunity becomes more
    advantageous - a switchover phenomenon absent in non-geometric network models.
    In addition to the epidemiological implications, we also discuss the fundamental
    properties of disease-induced immunization as a spatially-correlated node percolation
    process, including the susceptibility, the degree distribution and the component
    statistics, from a statistical physics perspective.

  Talk title: Critical behavior in multiscale epidemic models based on force of infection
  Abstract: The spread of epidemics when coupled with human behavior dynamics presents
    a challenge for accurate modeling and prediction.Leveraging on previous studies,
    we construct an epidemiological model that simultaneously accounts for the age
    structure of individuals, the heterogeneity of mobility, and the interplay between
    the time scales of infection and mobility processes.Starting from a metapopulation
    SIR model with reaction diffusion epidemic dynamic, we introduce an alternative
    formulation based on the force of infection framework, showing how both methods
    produce qualitatively comparable results and how the presence of heterogeneity
    in mobility reduces the final fraction of infected subpopulations.Additionally,
    the force of infection framework, capable of preserving the initial spatial distribution
    of population, is used to forecast the number of seasonal influenza infections
    in Italy.Overall, this work demonstrates how the impact of mobility varies depending
    on the modeling of the spreading process and provides an independent estimate
    for the Italian seasonalinfluenza forecasting service.

  Talk title: Optimal prevention strategies for chronic diseases in a compartmental
    disease trajectory model
  Abstract: In countries with growing elderly populations, multimorbidity poses a
    significant healthcare challenge.The trajectories along which diseases accumulate
    as patients age and how they can be targeted by prevention efforts are still not
    fully understood. We propose a compartmental model, traditionally used in infectious
    diseases, describing chronic disease trajectories across 132 distinct multimorbidity
    patterns (compartments). Leveraging a comprehensive dataset from approximately
    45 million hospital stays spanning 17 years in Austria, our compartmental disease
    trajectory model (CDTM) forecasts changes in the incidence of 131 diagnostic groups
    and their combinations until 2030, highlighting patterns involving hypertensive
    diseases with cardiovascular diseases and metabolic disorders. We pinpoint specific
    diagnoses with the greatest potential for preventive interventions to promote
    healthy aging. According to our model, a reduction of new onsets by 5% of hypertensive
    diseases (I10--I15) leads to a reduction in all-cause mortality over a period
    of 15 years by 0.57 (0.06)% and for malignant neoplasms (C00--C97) mortality is
    reduced by 0.57 (0.07)%.Furthermore, we use the model to assess the long-term
    consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic on hospitalizations, revealing earlier and
    more frequent hospitalizations across multiple diagnoses. Our fully data-driven
    approach identifies leverage points for proactive preparation by physicians and
    policymakers to reduce the overall disease burden in the population, emphasizing
    a shift towards patient-centered care.

  Talk title: 'Non-Markovian dynamics and basic reproduction number in COVID-19: evidence
    from Cyprus contact tracing data'
  Abstract: Using contact tracing data provided by the Cyprus Ministry of Health,
    infection networks are constructed for the first four waves of the COVID-19 pandemic.
    In these networks, nodes represent infected individuals, while links indicate
    the direction of transmission between them. For each transmission chain, the distribution
    of the hopcount of the infection path from the root node to all other nodes is
    calculated, aggregating the data of all the trees of the same size N in each wave.
    The COVID-infection process, which generates the observed infection trees, is
    modeled as a homogeneous non-Markovian SI process on the complete graph KN with
    N nodes, where the infection times T are Weibull distributed with shape parameter
    α. The shape parameter α gives an indication of the deviation of the underlying
    spreading process from a Markovian (α = 1) epidemic. The results comparing the
    empirical hopcount distribution of infection trees computed from data, non-Markovian
    SI simulations with Weibull infection times, and the approximated distribution
    Pr[hN = k] suggest that the non-Markovian properties of the epidemic process can
    be quantified using real-world infection trees. Nearly all α values are larger
    than one, suggesting that real-world epidemics are very likely characterized by
    non-exponential infection processes and therefore by non-Markovian dynamics. The
    infection trees extracted from the data also allow to estimate the average number
    of secondary infections caused by a primary case (basic reproduction number R0).
    The distribution of the hopcount ratio r[k]/= /Pr[HN/=/k]/Pr[HN/=/k/−/1] gives
    a more complete indication of the number of secondary infections compared to the
    R0.The study shows that analyzing the infection trees from contact tracing data,
    allows us to approximate the disease dynamics (via α) and quantify the strength
    of the epidemic process (approximations of R0). This knowledge refines epidemic
    spreading models and improves preparedness for future pandemics.

  Talk title: Assessing the potential impact of environmental land management schemes
    on emergent infectious disease risks
  Abstract: In this paper, we develop a network model for disease transmission risk
    between livestock and wild animals in Scotland, focusing on bovine tuberculosis
    and wildlife reservoirs. The network of land parcels connecting livestock to wild
    animals is crucial for inter-species infection problems and is influenced by land
    use change.Governments provide financial incentives to encourage woodland plantation
    to meet climate change and biodiversity targets. While these effects are largely
    positive, woodland expansion could increase wildlife presence near farms, enhancing
    the risk of disease transmission between wildlife and livestock.The network includes
    economic, ecological, and epidemiological considerations. First, an economic model
    predicts land use changes due to subsidies for woodland planting. Then the impact
    of these changes on wild deer populations in new woodland areas is estimated.
    The disease risk is then modelled by the proximity network of deer populations
    and cattle holdings.With increased subsidies, deer populations become more numerous
    and better connected to cattle holdings, increasing the risk of cross-species
    infection. In South-West Scotland, with diverse farms and existing woodland, we
    consider varying subsidy levels and new woodland scenarios. Although deer populations
    increase incrementally, contact between deer and cattle areas rises by 26\% to
    35\% compared to no subsidy.The model shows that increasing woodland subsidy,
    despite its benefits, also increases inter-species connectivity and disease risk.
    It provides a foundation for examining potential risk mitigation strategies, such
    as targeting subsidies in low-risk areas or creating buffer zones between woodland
    and agricultural holdings.
