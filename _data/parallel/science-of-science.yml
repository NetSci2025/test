  Talk title: Neural Embeddings of Citation Flows Capturing the Narrowing Idea Mobility
  Abstract: Scientific citations track the circulation of ideas and reflect the collective
    attention of the academic community. However, our understanding of how scientific
    horizons evolve amidst a surge in publications remains contradictory. To address
    this gap, we investigate the spatiotemporal scale of citation flows within the
    knowledge space, uncovering evidence of narrowing citation mobility and growing
    constraints of knowledge distance. These findings offer new insights into the
    diversity and efficiency of knowledge diffusion in science.Drawing on millions
    of papers in the field of physics, we apply the Doc2Vec algorithm leveraging the
    semantics of papers, to map the citation network into the embedded knowledge landscape
    of physics, quantifying the spatiotemporal dynamics of citation flows. We first
    observe an exponential distribution of citing distances, characterized by numerous
    short-distance flows and a few long-distance ones. Citation mobility is proximity-based,
    with diffusion likelihood decreasing as epistemic distance increases. Further
    simulations using the Gravity model confirm that epistemic distance and research
    popularity are key push-and-pull factors in citation mobility. To explore how
    citation mobility evolved, we group citation flows into different decades based
    on the citing date. Despite an increase in the volume of citation flows, we observe
    a decline in the proportion of cross-grid citation flows. Fitting citation flows
    by decade with Gravity models reveals a steady increase in the distance-damping
    exponent, indicating a growing barrier effect of distance on citing behavior over
    time. Finally, examining individual papers, we find that even as their citation
    counts increase, the breadth of their impact decreases over decades. Our results
    reflect increasingly localized and myopic information foraging in modern scientific
    practices. This trend underscores the urgent need to promote diverse knowledge
    exchange, ensuring long-term scientific innovation.

  Talk title: Who are your collaborators? Uncovering collaboration patterns in science
  Abstract: 'Scientific collaborations are shaped by many factors: common scientific
    interests, background, social interactions, availability, and so on. But what
    are the core mechanisms that drive collaborations? In our research, we focused
    on how researchers collaborate based on the similarity or complementarity of their
    skills. What we found is that these two mechanisms (similarity and complementarity)
    have distinct topological properties: similar collaborations have a higher tendency
    to form triangles since similarity is transitive and may lead to triangle closure,
    while complementary collaborations are characterized by the high density of quadrangles
    because complementarity leads to the formation of even-length motifs if the number
    of complementary domains is small. Our findings highlight the organization of
    collaborations in different fields of science. These results may help domain experts
    identify plausible new collaborations and also better understand the mid-scale
    structure of scientific fields, including communities ofcollaborators and relationships
    between scientific problems.'

  Talk title: Quantitative analysis of citation imbalance in computer science using
    reference models
  Abstract: Citation analysis is a standard bibliometric tool for assessing the impact
    of different papers, researchers, institutions, and countries [1]. Achieving fair
    citation analysis remains challenging due to the diverse citation practices across
    individual researchers and research disciplines. Indeed, the number of citations
    received by papers often exhibits imbalances in terms of the author's country
    of affiliation and gender. Gender imbalance persists in computer science across
    various aspects, including educational attainment, faculty representation, and
    career progression. While recent studies have highlighted citation imbalances
    related to authorsâ€™ gender in neuroscience and physics [2, 3], the extent of gendered
    citation imbalance in computer science remains largely unknown. Here, by deploying
    a family of reference models for citation networks, we quantify gender imbalance
    in citations between papers published in computer science conferences [4].

  Talk title: Quantifying Scientific Recognition Process in Complex Awarding Systems
  Abstract: 'Prizes confer credibility to individuals, ideas, and disciplines; provide
    financial incentives; and foster community-building celebrations. Despite considerable
    efforts to study the influence of prizes on scientists and scientific growth,
    most research focuses on individual prizes. Little is known about the broader
    recognition ecosystem and how prizes interact with one another. Gaining insight
    into these interactions can significantly enhance our understanding of how collective
    recognition, fame, and credit are allocated, amplified, and disseminated within
    the scientific community. It can also help us predict future winners and emerging
    hotspots in science. In this study, we curated three large-scale datasets on prizes,
    documenting the prize-winning records of more than 13,000 recipients across over
    6,000 prizes. This allowed us to construct a dynamical scientific prize network
    based on co-prizewinners and develop a minimal selection model that accurately
    captures both individual prize-winning trajectories and the collective behavior
    of the entire prize system. Our analysis further reveals a concerning trend: many
    prizes founded after 2000 disproportionately emphasize winners of already established
    prizes and ignoring new emerging talents. This overemphasis jeopardizes diversity
    and inclusivity in science, potentially stifling groundbreaking discoveries. By
    understanding and addressing these patterns, we can ensure that the scientific
    recognition system evolves to better support innovation and equity in the years
    to come.'

  Talk title: Quantifying Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) in Scientific Recognition
  Abstract: Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion are crucial for fostering creativity
    in scientific research. Despite its importance, DEI remains a persistent issue,
    particularly in scientific recognition and leadership. In this study, we curated
    large-scaled datasets to investigate gender disparities in scientific recognition
    and its relationship with collaboration networks. These datasets include career
    trajectories of over 900 prize winners and 700 journal editors, together with
    2M publications, and collaboration patterns of 900K scholars. Our findings reveal
    a significant underrepresentation of female scholars in leadership positions which
    cannot be fully explained by differences in productivity, citation counts, research
    fields, or career lengths. Instead, network effects provide a more compelling
    explanation. Specifically, scholars who collaborate more frequently with prize
    winners and journal editors are more likely to receive prizes or secure major
    editorial roles in the future. However, these collaboration opportunities are
    not distributed equitably where female scholars have fewer chances to collaborate
    with distinguished peers, a disparity potentially stemming from gender homophily
    in collaboration patterns. To further explore the connection between gender homophily
    and systemic equity by developing a dynamical network model. This model revealed
    a critical threshold for gender homophily. When homophily is below this threshold,
    gender equity can emerge organically. However, when it exceeds the threshold,
    gender disparity becomes entrenched, leading to the persistent underrepresentation
    of female scholars in leadership roles. Our study not only highlights the pervasive
    nature of gender disparity but also provides insights into its underlying causes.
    These findings carry strong policy implications, emphasizing the need for targeted
    interventions to address collaboration inequities and foster a more inclusive
    scientific community.
