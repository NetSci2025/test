  Talk title: 'Emerging Activity Temporal Hypergraph (EATH): a model for temporally
    and structurally heterogeneous time-varying hypergraphs'
  Abstract: 'We analyze several empirical temporal hypergraphs, uncovering non-trivial
    structural and temporal heterogeneities, and we propose a new model of time-varying
    hypergraph able to reproduce these properties. Several systems of social interactions
    present strong temporal heterogeneity, featuring bursty and correlated dynamics
    both at the level of individuals and of groups. Moreover, nodes create a non-trivial
    higher-order structure, by generating strong ties and interacting preferentially
    in groups of specific sizes. We propose a new model able to reproduce these properties,
    the Emerging Activity Temporal Hypergraph (EATH). The core idea of the model is
    that each node has its own evolution dynamics, transitioning between a state of
    low activity and a state of high activity, with a modulation due to the specific
    schedule of the system: the overall activity of the system emerges from the aggregated
    nodes activity. Nodes participating in active hyperedges are selected with probability
    proportional to their activity and to their propensity to engage interactions
    of a certain size. The hyperedge formation also follows a reinforcement mechanism
    with both short-term and long-term memory. The alternation of low and high activity
    phases dynamically generates correlations and heterogeneous bursty dynamics, both
    in the single nodes and groups activation. The parameters of the model can be
    tuned, making the model flexible and able to reproduce a broad variety of behaviors.
    We showed that, if the parameters are extracted from a given dataset, the model
    is indeed able to reproduce many properties of the empirical hypergraph both structurally
    and dynamically. We also explore how the model properties change when different
    transition rates and activity levels, as well as different memory mechanisms,
    are used. We thus highlight the flexibility of the model, which provides us with
    a detailed control on the generated temporal hypergraph''s properties.'

  Talk title: Emergence of stationarity in social and informational temporal networks
  Abstract: 'Temporal networks of social contact and information transfer often exhibit
    striking levels of stationarity at the system level, which emerge from bursty
    and highly variable interactions between individuals characterized by heterogeneous
    activity patterns. Here, we investigate the conditions under which seemingly erratic
    behavior at the individual level gives rise to stable collective dynamics in temporal
    networks.Through the analysis of numerous empirical temporal networks (social
    or informational), we identify robust patterns in the evolution of network connectivity
    over time. Node degrees self-regulate in such a way that poorly connected individuals
    tend to gain links between consecutive observation windows, while hubs lose edges.
    At the population level, this translates into periodic oscillations of degree
    and degree change. Such oscillations not only signal the presence of system-wide
    stability, but appear at a specific aggregation scale of the underlying interaction
    events, which surprisingly coincides with the time scale at which the aggregated
    temporal network appears to be maximally dynamic.A simple model of temporal egocentric
    network evolution based on renewal processes is able to reproduce these empirical
    observations, offering an analytical master equation approach to describe connectivity
    dynamics in networks.In the datasets, we distinguish between two categories of
    temporal networks based on the stability of the emergent connectivity cycles:
    networks for which the dynamics of degree change is cyclic, and networks for which
    it drifts over time. We also identify the dominant time scales of the observed
    oscillations, which do not always coincide with circadian rhythms of human activity,
    revealing previously hidden scales of temporal networks. Our work provides insight
    on how society-wide collective patterns of stationarity may arise from irregular
    interactions between individuals.'

  Talk title: Tracking Community Evolution via Multi-Faceted Events
  Abstract: Many real-world networks come as evolving topologies whose nodes and edges
    appear/vanish as time goes by. Similarly, the meso-scale substructures within
    these networks also undergo constant change. The task of Dynamic Community Detection
    addresses the challenge of identifying and tracking the evolution of network communities
    over time. This process is typically described using community events, which represent
    the transformations a community can experience throughout its lifecycle. However,
    real-world community evolution often involves complex, multi-faceted transformations
    that do not fit neatly into these mutually exclusive categories. As a result,
    traditional classifications fail to adequately capture these dynamics, and frequently
    resort to arbitrary thresholds and assumptions. In this work, we reconceptualize
    classical events as archetypes, i.e., typical examples of a category conveying
    its most salient features. In contrast, real-world events can exhibit features
    from multiple of these archetypes. To tackle this more complex definition, we
    reimagine events as a unique combination of three dimensions, which we call Unicity,
    Identity, and Outflow.Each event is thus defined by its position in this 3D space,
    in which classical events occupy corners. Consequently, we can compute the similarity
    between real and archetypal events as a combination of these dimensions.We applied
    this methodology to dynamic communities extracted from datasets capturing face-to-face
    interactions, demonstrating its ability to provide more reliable insights into
    group dynamics compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, we show that
    our framework has applications beyond simply characterizing community evolution.
    This includes selecting appropriate aggregation time scales, assessing temporal
    partition stability, and evaluating event quality.

  Talk title: 'Decentralised federated learning over temporal networks: the role of
    temporal heterogeneity'
  Abstract: Moving beyond previous assumptions of static, fully synchronous communication
    networks, we investigate the role of temporal heterogeneities in the trajectory
    of decentralised federated learning. We demonstrate the connection between initial
    synchronisation phase of decentralised federated learning and diffusion processes,
    showing that the system evolves according to the same trajectory as the inverse
    participation ratio of a passive lazy random walk on the communication temporal
    network. Unlike active continuous-time active random walks on static networks,
    where convergence times depend primarily on the variance of inter-event intervals,
    we find that for passive random walks, second moments alone do not fully predict
    the rapidity of the relaxation of random walk process and thus the federated learning
    process. This is in most parts due to the complications arising from the discrepancies
    between residual and inter-event time distributions, also known as the waiting
    time paradox. This highlights that temporal heterogeneity is an important factor
    in shaping the initial synchronisation phase in decentralised federated learning
    as well as many other systems that can be modelled as diffusion processes.

  Talk title: Entropy-Informed Dynamic Community Detection
  Abstract: 'Temporal network evolution is characterised by archetypal structural
    changes. One of the main difficulties of community discovery in temporal networks
    resides in identifying when such changes occur. This type of information, besides
    being in itself important, is relevant for community detection: the performance
    of existing community detection methods increases when applied on structurally
    stable time intervals. Specifically, the precision benefits from avoiding mixing
    events that occur at different times, and the recall benefits from focusing on
    time windows where community structures are well-defined. For instance, Flow Stability
    is a multi-scale clustering method for temporal networks capable of detecting
    the presence of communities in temporal networks that are stable in time. This
    method is based on the continuous-time random walk dynamic over temporal networks.
    In the spirit of this approach, and inspired by other works showcasing the importance
    of diffusion entropy in static networks, we introduce the use of conditional entropy
    to identify structural changes in dynamic networks. First, we compute two conditional
    entropy curves: one for the diffusion forward in time and one for the diffusion
    backward in time. Heuristically, the entropy curve of forward diffusion identifies
    expansion dynamics, whereas the entropy of backward diffusion identifies shrinking
    dynamics. Secondly, we process the signals by subtracting the expected conditional
    entropy evolution in a complete graph, smoothing and computing their derivatives
    to detect change points. Finally, we perform dynamical community detection on
    each sub-interval determined by the final temporal partition. This approach is
    relevant for both clustering algorithms that rely on the aggregation of temporal
    networks and those that do not: for the former, we get a principled way to aggregate
    the temporal network; for the latter, we obtain sub-intervals where the networks
    are more stable and suited for clustering.'

  Talk title: Patterns in Temporal Networks with Higher-Order Egocentric Structures
  Abstract: Classical network representations often fail to fully capture the complexity
    of real-world systems. While more sophisticated frameworks, such as temporal networks,
    offer flexibility but with increased analytical complexity. Longa et al. [1] introduced
    an  egocentric perspective, focusing on a node’s evolving neighborhood (ETN),
    useful for characterizing temporal social networks but limited in addressing higher-order
    interactions that impact network dynamics.We propose a framework extending ETN
    from graphs to hypergraphs, defining the hyper egocentric temporal neighborhood
    (HETN) to capture more complex information, including hyperedges and their evolution
    [2]. We encode HETN information into vectors called hyper egocentric temporal
    neighborhood signatures (HETNS). Furthermore we can reduce an entire set of HETNs
    to the only significant structures with respect to a null model, leading to a
    set of hyper egocentric temporal motifs (HETM). Using data from 10 proximity datasets,
    we find that the differences between hypergraphs are mostly due to second-order
    HETMs. At individual node level second-order structures are more sensitive to
    node dissimilarities.Our results show that second-order structures in HETNs are
    critical for capturing variability in social interactions, unveiling behaviors
    that could not be appreciated if limiting the analysis to the first order. This
    approach has potential for classifying temporal data and generating synthetic
    datasets.[1] Longa, A., et al. Data Min Knowl Disc 36, 355-378 (2022)[2] Arregui-Garc´ıa
