  Talk title: Homophily Within and Across Groups
  Abstract: Traditional social network analysis often reduces homophily—the tendency
    of similar individuals to connect—to a single parameter, neglecting nuanced biases
    within and across groups. We propose an exponential family model that incorporates
    both local homophily (strong ties within cliques) and global homophily (weaker
    ties across communities), using a maximum entropy approach to analyze their effects
    on network dynamics under percolation. This framework decomposes homophily into
    finer levels, revealing how these interactions shape the spread of information,
    diseases, and innovation. Testing on diverse datasets, the model highlights how
    varying homophily patterns influence percolation thresholds and the effectiveness
    of interventions, offering valuable insights for public health strategies, social
    media information flow, and targeted mitigation efforts.

  Talk title: Multigraph reconstruction via nonlinear random walks
  Abstract: Network science provides a powerful framework for modeling complex systems,
    where the intricate interplay between structure and dynamics often leads to the
    emergence of complex behaviors such as synchronization and collective motion.
    Random walks, as one of the most studied stochastic processes, play a central
    role in exploring this interplay. However, traditional models often assume independent
    random walkers, overlooking real-world constraints such as finite carrying capacities
    at nodes. Addressing this limitation, recent studies introduced nonlinear diffusion
    processes that account for node capacity limits, enabling the inference of network
    structure through localized measurements and inverse problem-solving. In this
    work, we extend these nonlinear diffusion models to multigraphs, where nodes are
    connected by multiple types of links, each carrying distinct attributes. Examples
    of such systems include air transport networks categorized by airlines or social
    networks differentiated by interaction platforms. We show how the degree distribution
    of an entire multigraph can be reconstructed by combining knowledge of one link
    type with stationary density measurements from a single node. Through simulations
    on diverse multigraph topologies, including Erdős-Rényi, Watts-Strogatz, and scale-free
    networks, we evaluate the reconstruction accuracy and robustness of the proposed
    approach. Our findings demonstrate the capability to accurately infer key structural
    properties, such as degree distribution and moments, even under varying levels
    of sparsity and topology. This study strengthens the connection between network
    dynamics and topology, offering a novel framework for structural inference in
    multigraphs with limited information.

  Talk title: Multilayer Network Clustering to Assess Epidemic Model Dependence
  Abstract: Each year, the CDC hosts the FluSight Forecast Challenge, where over 40
    teams contribute to the flu forecasts. To create an ensemble forecast, the CDC
    takes the median of each quantile prediction across all models, assuming each
    provides statistically independent information. However, this assumption may not
    always hold, as models may share analytical frameworks, code, data, or calibrate
    on the same target variables (e.g. flu season peaks). The focus is to isolate
    sources of independent error and identify clusters of similar models to better
    understand ensemble performance and limitations.Using methodologies from climate
    forecasting, we first quantify the “effective number” of independent models by
    isolating independent noise from predictions. Our findings reveal that the effective
    number of models providing unique information is around 6—far fewer than the total
    number of models—indicating significant redundancy in the FluSight ensemble. This
    emphasizes a significant limitation in the current ensemble approach, where non-independent
    contributions may inflate the perceived diversity of forecasts.To further explore
    model dependencies, we apply a multilayer network clustering approach, combining
    similarity measures and multilayer community detection to cluster models with
    shared error patterns. Synthetic data experiments validate the pipeline’s robustness,
    correctly identifying ground truth groupings with independent, group-specific,
    and correlated noise. When applied to FluSight models, we observe temporal inconsistencies
    in groupings, likely driven by updates to individual models throughout the flu
    season.Our results highlight the need to address model interdependencies in epidemic
    forecasting. By quantifying the effective number of independent models and providing
    tools to isolate independent error, we offer a framework for improving ensemble
    reliability. These insights are essential for enhancing forecast accuracy and
    supporting public health decision-making.

  Talk title: Large-Scale and Multi-Layered Analysis of K-Beauty Patents Using LLMs
  Abstract: 'In this study, we analyze 19,563 patent abstracts, extracting approximately
    100,000 keywords with the objective of constructing a comprehensive keyword co-occurrence
    network. The keywords were categorized into seven predefined tags: efficacy, mechanism,
    ingredient/substance, natural, formulation/product, technique/manufacturing, and
    characteristics. This enabled a detailed exploration of the technological domains
    within K-Beauty.This study addresses the aforementioned limitations by employing
    a multi-layer network analysis, a novel approach that integrates the seven defined
    tags and thus represents a significant advancement in the field of cosmetic patents.
    Centrality analysis is the foundation of our methodology, identifying influential
    keywords that define key technological areas. The degree centrality metric identifies
    common keywords such as ''conditioner'', ''toner'' and ''cream'' that represent
    the formulation/product. Betweenness centrality identifies keywords such as ''anti-inflammatory'',
    ''antioxidant'', ''anti-wrinkle'' and ''whitening'', which are related to efficacy.A
    temporal analysis of the keyword network also reveals shifts in the focus of innovation,
    such as the transition from "whitening" to "anti-aging" and the growth of natural
    ingredients over time. The introduction of a multi-layered tagging framework to
    large-scale patent analysis provides a unique perspective on the evolution of
    the K-beauty technology landscape.The findings contribute to both the academic
    understanding of network science applications and the practical realm of R\&D
    planning, patent strategy, and technology forecasting. This research establishes
    a new standard for the utilization of LLMs and multi-layer network analysis in
    large-scale patent studies, exemplifying their efficacy in elucidating technological
    trends and innovation pathways within the cosmetics industry.'
