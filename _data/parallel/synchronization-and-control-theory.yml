  Talk title: Synchronization by convex optimization
  Abstract: Synchronization is relevant in a wide range of disciplines. This phenomenon
    is commonly studied using the Kuramoto model, which describes the dynamics of
    a system of coupled oscillators with varying natural frequencies and sinusoidal
    coupling. In electric power systems, the synchronization of generators is essential
    for ensuring a reliable supply of electricity. The generator's dynamics is described
    by a second order Kuramoto model where the sinusoidal coupling term gives the
    flow of real power across transmission lines. Stable operation requires that phases
    are locked and phase differences across lines must be below a certain bound $\gamma$,
    a condition referred to as phase cohesiveness. Hence, it is of utmost interest
    to understand when a network supports a phase cohesive state and when it does
    not.In this contribution we introduce a novel approach to the synchronization
    and phase cohesiveness problem based on mapping the fixed point equations to a
    convex optimization problem. This approach allows us to systematically compute
    all synchronized states where the phase difference across an edge does not exceed
    $\pi/2$, including exotic states with loop flows. Furthermore, our approach sheds
    light onto the  commonly used ``DC'' approximation, where the sinusoidal coupling
    function is linearized. We derive rigorous bounds on the error introduced by the
    linear approximation, obtaining a region of trust for individual lines. Based
    on these results, we find a rigorous sufficient condition on the existence of
    phase cohesive states that holds regardless of the underlying network topology.
    We demonstrate our results for an adapted Matpower 30-bus test case.

  Talk title: Low-dimensional network controllability
  Abstract: Identifying the driver nodes of a network has crucial implications in
    complex systems from unveiling causal interactions to informing effective intervention
    strategies. Despite recent advances in network control theory, results remain
    inaccurate as the number of drivers becomes too small compared to the network
    size, thus limiting the concrete usability in many real-life applications. To
    overcome this issue, we introduced a framework that integrates principles from
    spectral graph theory and output controllability to project the network state
    into a smaller topological space formed by the Laplacian network structure. Through
    extensive simulations on synthetic and real networks, we showed that reducing
    the dimension of the original network state to a lower number of projected components
    improves the control accuracy, here measured as the capacity of the driver nodes
    to effectively steer the system towards desired target configurations. Taken together,
    our results offer a theoretically-grounded solution to effectively translate network
    controllability into concrete applications.

  Talk title: Critical threshold for synchronizability of high-dimensional Kuramoto
    oscillators under higher-order interactions
  Abstract: Collective synchronization of the Kuramoto model has been extensively
    studied in diverse scientific disciplines, and since then, it has been generalized
    in various perspectives.  As the Kuramoto model itself is defined on the unit
    circle as a one-dimensional object, it however would not be suitable to model  high-dimensional
    behaviors appropriately. Moreover, another limitation is that it is restricted
    to two-body interactions. In this presentation based on [1], we focus on the high-dimensional
    Kuramoto model particularly together with three-body interactions. For this model,  {we
    find a critical threshold for complete synchronizability  in terms of interaction
    strengths. Precisely, by denoting $\kappa_1$ and $\kappa_2$ for two- and three-body
    interaction strengths, respectively, we show that if $\kappa_1+\kappa_2>0$, then
    complete synchronization can emerge, whereas if $\kappa_1+\kappa_2<0$, then complete
    synchronization cannot occur. For the critical case $\kappa_1+\kappa_2=0$,} we
    show that the emergence of complete synchronization crucially depends on the sign
    of  $\kappa_1$ and particularly that critical slowing down is observed at critical
    transition. It should be mentioned that the  line $\kappa_1+\kappa_2=0$ was mentioned
    in [2] where the readers can easily notice that the line seems critical. Our theoretical
    results are supplemented by numerical experiments which also provide qualitative
    insight not captured in the theoretical analysis.

  Talk title: Analytic relationship of relative synchronizability to network structure
    and motifs
  Abstract: 'We recently presented (doi:10.1073/pnas.2303332120) an analytic technique
    to directly measure the relative synchronizability of noise-driven time-series
    processes on networks, as a function of the underlying directed network structure.
    We consider both continuous-time and discrete-time linear dynamics on networks,
    which can represent linearization around an attractor for non-linear dynamics
    such as the Kuramoto model. These are a common starting point, leading to well-known
    bounds on eigenvalues for whether a given network structure will synchronise or
    not.Going beyond "sync-or-not", our new approach is able to fully and generally
    relate the structure of a network to how well it will synchronize. We quantify
    the quality of synchronization in terms of total expected deviation from synchronization
    in response to a single perturbation, or equivalently steady-state divergence
    from synchronization (or variance across nodes) under driving noise. Our approach
    represents a substantial advance over existing methods: we handle directed, weighted
    connections, and non-diagonalizable networks.More importantly, our approach can
    be expanded to fully interpret the complete impact of local network structure
    on whole of network synchronizability. Our results show that the deviation from
    synchronization is fully determined by the proportion of paired walks (or process
    motifs) on the network which converge rather than diverge: the more convergent
    paired walks, the worse the quality of synchronization. A simple corollary is
    that more clustered structure, which induces more convergent walks, leads to deviations
    away from synchronization. This explains many known results, for example that
    regular and small-world networks exhibit worse quality synchronization than random
    networks. Our results also reveal subtle differences in the relevant walks involved
    in determining deviation from synchronization in discrete-time versus continuous-time
    dynamics.'

  Talk title: Efficient Identification of Critical Control Nodes in Probabilistic
    Directed Networks and Their Associations with Disease Genes
  Abstract: Network controllability integrates classical control theory with structural
    network insights from large-scale biological systems, such as intracellular molecular
    and brain neuronal networks[1-3]. While the set of minimum driver nodes is non-unique,
    critical nodes, those present in every solution, are crucial for network control.
    A key challenge in network control is dealing with edge failures and uncertainties
    in molecular interactions, especially in directed probabilistic networks [4].
    To address this, we introduce a probabilistic control framework based on the minimum
    dominating set (MDS), which incorporates the probabilistic nature of directed
    molecular interactions to identify critical control nodes. Our algorithm, enhanced
    by novel mathematical propositions, offers efficient identification of critical
    nodes in large probabilistic networks [5]. As shown in Figure 1ab, the human intracellular
    signal transduction network is represented with links having varying failure probabilities.
    To efficiently identify control categories, we use a preprocessing step based
    on four mathematical propositions that capture a large fraction of control nodes
    (Fig. 1c). The remaining nodes are identified using an integer linear programming
    (ILP)-based algorithm (Fig. 1d). Our analysis shows that a small fraction of nodes
    are classified as critical node  (Fig. 1e). Further exhaustive analysis of multiple
    diseases reveals that critical control nodes are associated with key biological
    features and perturbed gene sets, including SARS-CoV-2 targets, Type 1 Diabetes
    Mellitus (Fig. 1f), and rare diseases like cytokine receptor deficiency. This
    methodology can be applied to study biological systems where directed edges are
    probabilistic, whether in natural systems or those modeled with high uncertainties
    in silico.
