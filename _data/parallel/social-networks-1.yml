  Talk title: Multi-scale modularity in networks of agents that adapt to increase
    their relevance
  Abstract: 'Many biological, social, and economic systems evolve over time to exhibit
    modularity at multiple scales. The current work aims at developing a model of
    the formation of hierarchically organized modules in originally undifferentiated
    systems. The specific question addressed by the generative modeling is:  can hierarchical
    modularity emerge from vertices that simply adapt their outgoing edge weights
    to other vertices so as to increase their relevance within the network?As a concrete
    example for expository purposes, imagine that there 50 authors who are connected
    to each other by a directed 50 X 50 matrix of continuously valued weights that
    can be interpreted as the amount of readership traffic that each author sends
    to every other author through their citations.  The following three steps are
    taken: 1) Each agent calculates its steady-state readership traffic, 2A) random
    Gaussian noise is added to each agent''s 50-length vector of outgoing weights
    (e.g. transition probabilities), 3) The steady-state readership traffic is recalculated
    and if it is greater than it was in Step 1, then the change to outgoing weights
    is kept, otherwise it is reverted to the old weights.The simulations demonstrate
    several phenomena related to the emergence of multiscale modules: 1) reciprocal
    connections (when vertex A connects strongly to B, then B connects strongly to
    A), 2) densely connected cliques above the dyadic level, 3) increasing modularity
    and number of communities as the network evolves, and 4) a fine-to-coarse pattern
    of community formation.  Thus, multiscale modularity can arise in networks even
    without incorporating spatial proximity, explicit collaborations, fields, trust,
    coalitions, external inputs, or similarity, pointing to possibly widespread applicability
    to economic trade, social organizations, professional networks, social media structures,
    and neural circuits.'

  Talk title: Estimating network effects and their uncertainty in discrete choice
    modelling
  Abstract: Human choices are shaped by preferences and often influenced by network
    effects through social connections. Understanding these network effects helps
    policymakers design interventions based on behaviour spread, marketers craft campaigns
    based on peer influence, and electoral planners compare the impact of socioeconomic
    variables and network influences on voter preferences. In our research, we estimate
    the extent to which a decision maker’s choice is influenced by their network connections
    versus their individual attributes. Importantly, we quantify the uncertainty of
    these estimations, which offers multiple benefits - it prevents over-reliance
    on potentially inaccurate estimations due to limited or noisy data, and it enables
    consideration of network-induced uncertainties while evaluating counterfactual
    scenarios such as altering future choice sets. We achieve this by developing a
    Bayesian non-parametric model to capture network effects using a Gaussian process
    over graphs. Within the discrete choice framework, we represent the utility of
    an item to a decision maker as a sum of this graph-based network effect and a
    covariate effect based on the individual’s and choice item’s features. The decision
    maker selects the item with the highest utility in the available choice set. Our
    Bayesian formulation allows us to quantify the uncertainty of the network effect
    on utility using the posterior distribution. The graph-based Gaussian process
    kernel hyperparameters are learned using gradient descent, eliminating the need
    for manual hyperparameter tuning. We show that smooth graph-based kernels yield
    well-calibrated network-induced uncertainties and validate them on real-world
    datasets, including US election results and Android app installation data.

  Talk title: Intersectional inequalities in social networks
  Abstract: 'Social categories, such as race, gender, or socioeconomic status, are
    core driving forces of social tie formation. They shape our identities, determining
    our social behavior and our connection preferences. Homophily, the preference
    for connecting with similar others, is one of the most common and widely studied
    interaction patterns; however, the dynamics driving multidimensional connection
    preferences remain largely unexplored. Furthermore, while homophily in social
    networks leads to enhanced trust between individuals, it also exacerbates segregation
    and breeds inequality. As individuals belong to multiple groups, people can experience
    marginalization in several dimensions simultaneously, suffering intersectional
    inequalities.In this work, we develop a network model of homo / heterophilic interactions
    with multidimensional attribute vectors. We use the model to tackle two crucial
    questions: How do we integrate information from our multidimensional identities
    to form connections with each other, and how do multidimensional connection preferences
    impact intersectional inequalities of social capital?To answer the first question,
    we systematically model group-preference aggregation mechanisms and compare them
    using Bayesian model selection. We find that a simple aggregation mechanism consistently
    outperforms more complex alternatives.We also use the model to operationalize
    intersectional inequalities of social capital and derive analytical closed-form
    expressions for the predicted inter-group degree inequalities. We demonstrate
    that when attributes are uncorrelated, multidimensional degree disparities mirror
    one-dimensional systems, but attribute correlation induces counterintuitive patterns
    of emergent intersectionality. For example, for certain population distributions,
    the parameter regimes where majorities and minorities are advantaged are reversed.
    We verify the model''s predictions with real-world network data, finding a remarkable
    alignment.'

  Talk title: Curiosity Priming Shifts Attention to Well-Informed Nodes in Social
    Ego Networks
  Abstract: This study explores the impact of social norms and affordances on user
    attention in a simulated social media environment. By priming with curiosity and
    manipulating the platform design, participants dwell longer on and spend more
    time engaging with content from well-informed personas, even without explicitly
    revealing their defining traits. This finding suggests that subtle modifications
    to platform design and social norms have the potential to influence user behavior
    and mitigate the spread of misinformation.

  Talk title: Unveiling emerging moderation dynamics in Mastodon’s federated instance
    network.
  Abstract: 'In the past years we have witnessed a vast migration of users from classical
    social platforms like Twitter to Decentralized Online Social Networks (DOSNs)
    such as Mastodon. Mastodon operates as a network of independent and decentralized
    servers, known as instances, that communicate with one another. The rapid growth
    in the number of users is reshaping Mastodon’s network structure and altering
    the flow of information among instances and individual users. This growth also
    presents challenges in identifying and managing harmful servers. To address these
    issues, Mastodon provides instance administrators with tools for moderating inter-instance
    interactions.This study examines the interplay between the friendship network
    of instances and Mastodon’s moderation mechanisms, revealing the main underlying
    patterns and how they affect the propagation of mis/information. By analyzing
    structural changes in the network over a year, we observe that the actors of the
    moderation process change over time. Despite these shifts at the microscopic scale,
    the analysis of motifs distributions and network balance over time reveals the
    presence of stable structures at the macroscopic level. In addition, the structure
    of the banning-banned network unveils two natural sets of instances: a larger
    group (M)comprising banned instances and a smaller minority group (m) responsible
    for most bannings. To understand the flowof information we employ an information
    diffusion model able to reveal the propagation of mis/information. Our findings
    show that minority group instances share information predominantly within their
    group, while the majority group exhibits less cohesive communication. Regarding
    the cross-information spreading, we observe that the nodes in the majority get
    rapidly isolated while the spreading from the minority to the majority is more
    resilient under changes of the network. Additionally, an echo-chamber effect emerges,
    isolating the minority group from untrusted servers.'

  Talk title: An exploration of equilibrium dynamics in social structures
  Abstract: The dynamics of personal relationships remain largely unexplored due to
    the inherent difficulties of the longitudinal data collection process. In this
    paper, we analyze a dataset tracking the temporal evolution of a network of personal
    relationships among 900 people over the course of four years. We search for evidence
    that the network is in equilibrium, meaning that all macroscopic properties remain
    constant, fluctuating around stable values, while the internal microscopic dynamics
    are active. We find that the probabilities governing the network dynamics are
    stationary over time and that the degree distributions, as well as edge and triangle
    abundances match the theoretical equilibrium distributions expected under these
    dynamics (see Fig. 1). Furthermore, we verify that the system satisfies the detailed
    balance condition, with only minor point deviations, confirming that it is indeed
    in equilibrium. Remarkably, this equilibrium persists despite a high turnover
    in network composition, suggesting that it is an inherent characteristic of human
    social interactions rather than a trait of the individuals themselves. We argue
    that this equilibrium may be a general feature of human social networks arising
    from the competition between different dynamical mechanisms and also from the
    cognitive and material resources management of individuals. From a practical perspective,
    the fact that networks are in equilibrium could simplify data collection processes,
    validate the use of cross-sectional data-based methods like Exponential Random
    Graph Models, and inform the design of interventions. Our findings advance the
    understanding of collective human behavior predictability and our ability to describe
    it using simple mathematical models.

  Talk title: Fairness in Social Influence Maximization via Optimal Transport
  Abstract: We study fairness in social influence maximization, whereby one seeks
    to select seeds that spread a given information throughout a network, ensuring
    balanced outreach among different communities (e.g. demographic groups). In the
    literature, fairness is often quantified in terms of the expected outreach within
    individual communities. In this paper, we demonstrate that such fairness metrics
    can be misleading since they overlook the stochastic nature of information diffusion
    processes. When information diffusion occurs in a probabilistic manner, multiple
    outreach scenarios can occur. As such, outcomes such as ``In 50\% of the cases,
    no one in group 1 gets the information, while everyone in group 2 does, and in
    the other 50%, it is the opposite'', which always results in largely unfair outcomes,
    are classified as fair by a variety of fairness metrics in the literature. We
    tackle this problem by designing a new fairness metric, mutual fairness, that
    captures variability in outreach through optimal transport theory. We propose
    a new seed-selection algorithm that optimizes both outreach and mutual fairness,
    and we show its efficacy on several real datasets. We find that our algorithm
    increases fairness with only a minor decrease (and at times, even an increase)
    in efficiency.

  Talk title: Efficient network intervention with chain-referral sampling data
  Abstract: Most existing studies assume that the network topology is already known
    when designing intervention strategies, which is difficult to achieve in practice.
    We focus on network intervention with sampling information and assume that the
    nodes are obtained by graph sampling algorithms, where chain-referral sampling
    methods make it easier to sample nodes with more neighbors. Moreover, we propose
    a percolation framework to analyze network attacks with such chain-referral sampling
    data. For a generalized random network with discrete degree distribution, the
    analytic solution of the relative size of the giant component could be obtained
    with any given sampling proportion and attack proportion. At the same time, the
    analysis model is extended by introducing a cutoff proportion to maximize the
    intervention effect of the sampling information. Experiments in model and empirical
    networks show that the optimal cutoff proportion estimated by sampling data could
    effectively improve the attack effect. The intervention effect of sampling partial
    data could approach that of complete data when selecting the appropriate cutoff
    degree proportion. This study could provide a reference for effective rumors management
    and disease prevention in real social networks.
