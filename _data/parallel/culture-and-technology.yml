  Talk title: Software Package Complexity - Modular Structure vs. Modular Design
  Abstract: Function calls extracted from static call graphs can be grouped in different
    ways, for example by using community detection and according to how developers
    have collected functions, methods, and classes in the source code files. We use
    the map equation to quantify the complexity of those two different ways of partitioning
    the static call graphs of software packages. With flow divergence, we measure
    the excess complexity of the structure in source code files relative to their
    communities, which can help hint at the need or opportunity of refactoring the
    codebase.

  Talk title: A day on Twitter is a fractal in socio-cultural space-time
  Abstract: The day-on-Twitter dataset covers a complete day of communication. The
    weighted social network of reciprocated mentions contains 7.2M nodes and 9.2M
    edges. It is a small-world network with a characteristic path length as that of
    a corresponding random network. Another paradigmatic network topology is that
    of self-similarity. A network is self-similar if the minimum number of boxes needed
    to cover the network scales as a power law with the size of the box. The self-similar
    property is theoretically at odds with the small-world property because self-similar
    networks have large characteristic path lengths. The complete social network of
    reciprocated mentions is not self-similar. However, we know that small-world networks
    can have an underlying self-similar structure when weak ties are removed. We develop
    this line of research by applying percolation theory. Using minimum tie strength
    s_min as a control parameter, we identify a topological phase transition at s_min=4.
    This transition is marked by a sharp decrease of the percolation probability (fraction
    of nodes in the largest component) and a maximization of the susceptibility (average
    size of all components but the largest). Only at the critical value, the distribution
    of component sizes is a power law and the network is self-similar. To shed light
    on the mentioning dynamics, we define a connectivity avalanche as an event in
    which a user continuously mentions, or is continually mentioned by, another user.
    The avalanche size scales as a power law with its frequency (inverse duration).
    The exponent is between -1.30 and -1.55. This means that the mentioning practice
    resembles fractal Brownian motion with rather long-term memory. In the talk, we
    will discuss further results about the cultural dynamics, how they contribute
    to our conclusion that a day on Twitter is a fractal in socio-cultural space-time,
    and how we think structure and dynamics go hand in hand to form what we can then
    measure.

  Talk title: Learning in a Software Task Space
  Abstract: In the rapidly evolving global economy, the computer science and software
    industry represents one of the fastest-developing sectors. Today, the software
    industry is a major sector, with over half of the ten most valuable companies
    in the world operating on the internet and in software markets. However, we know
    little about the exact nature of jobs in the software sector itself, including
    their task composition and the evolution thereof. This restricts our ability to
    anticipate future trends and help workers, firms and countries adapt to the changing
    demands of the software labor market. To meet this challenge, we focus on the
    computer science and software industry and extract tasks from data from Stack
    Overflow, an online question-answer platform for computer programming topics.
    Utilizing network science tools, we construct a task space for individuals involved
    in software development and other programming activities. This framework allows
    us to define tasks to facilitate an in-depth analysis of work in the software
    industry. Our research provides a powerful and insightful framework to study the
    software industry landscape and the labour market.

  Talk title: 'Technological portfolio strategies: coherence, coreness, and diversification
    patterns'
  Abstract: 'Globalization and rapid technological advancements have heightened competition
    among firms. Both startups and established companies face obsolescence if they
    cling to specific technologies or business areas. To survive and drive innovation,
    many firms adopt technological portfolio diversification strategies to expand
    their technological domains.A prominent approach is related diversification, where
    firms extend their portfolios into closely related technologi- cal areas. The
    relationship between related diversification and firm performance has been a central
    topic in manage- ment research. Recent studies utilizing the concept of “relatedness”
    have quantified proximities between technologies and constructed technology relatedness
    networks. Prior research [1] indicates that firms with more consistent portfo-
    lios—comprising closely related technologies—tend to perform better, though this
    trend is predominantly driven by a small number of large firms.This study introduces
    a novel framework for quantitatively evaluating technological portfolios using
    three metrics: degree of related diversification (for which we propose a new measure),
    portfolio coherence [1], and technology coreness (a modified measure [2]). Using
    patent data, we analyzed the characteristics and temporal evolution of portfolios
    across firms of varying sizes and industries. Our findings reveal that most firms’
    core technological domains do not align with the central nodes of cohesive diversification
    (see Fig. 1). Smaller firms often pursue niche strategies, combining unrelated
    or sparsely populated domains. Temporal analyses uncovered distinct diversification
    patterns influenced by portfolio size and the uniqueness of technological domains.This
    framework offers actionable insights for firms seeking to refine their portfolio
    strategies, helping them effectively expand or concentrate their technological
    focus based on core strengths, resource constraints, competitive dynamics, and
    market conditions.'

  Talk title: 'Digitising History: Network Perspectives of a Medieval Court'
  Abstract: 'Networks offer a powerful lens for historians, allowing them to analyze
    the complex interplay of individuals, groups, and institutions over time.  Our
    research, part of the "Managing Maximilian" project, uses the network paradigm
    to explore the multifaceted interactions around Maximilian I (1459–1519), the
    Habsburg emperor renowned for his strategic and propagandistic skills. In our
    subproject, Digitising Maximilian, we are building a digital platform that integrates
    and analyses data from different contexts. The data model, ibased the “factoid
    approach”, ensures interoperability while accommodating diverse datasets, providing
    a large knowledge graph in which several types of Entities are connected through
    Statements. While building the platform, we ran some preliminary temporal network
    analysis on short texts from the dataset Regesta Imperii XIII. Standard network
    methods revealed diachronic shifts in relationships, demonstrating the potential
    of network techniques for prosopographical studies. Building on these insights,
    we now incorporate more granular datasets from the ManMax project, introducing
    multiplex networks that capture distinct types of interactions, such as correspondences,
    payments, or events. This approach mitigates the overrepresentation issues of
    co-occurrence models by differentiating layers and their interrelations. Early
    results are promising: the network, though still small, shows emergent structures
    like a giant component and recurrent patterns of activities, highlighting the
    intricate mechanisms of influence and collaboration at the emperor’s court. As
    the database grows, we anticipate identifying large connected components across
    multiple layers and future plans include inferring hidden elements in the network—such
    as unrecorded female actors or emergent communities—using for instance graph embeddings.
    These tools will help uncover latent connections, offering unprecedented insights
    into the social fabric of Maximilian''s reign.'

  Talk title: The Economic Complexity of the Roman Empire
  Abstract: Economic complexity is a key concept allowing us to forecast the growth
    of a country. Given its relevance for economic development, much attention has
    been devoted into studying how countries acquire economic complexity. In this
    work, we take a historic perspective, hypothesizing that complexity from many
    centuries in the past leaves detectable traces today.We leverage a dataset of
    500k Latin inscriptions created during the span of the Roman Empire. From these
    inscriptions, we obtain geolocated data about the occupations in the Roman Empire.
    We can create a bipartite province-occupation network, after dealing with biases
    of archaeological data -- gender disparities, occupation status, diversity in
    research intensity.The data shows the nestedness pattern typical of modern economies
    -- with complex places including all occupations and basic occupations expressed
    in every place. We create an Occupation Space, linking occupations if they co-appear
    significantly in the same places (Fig 1a).We can estimate the economic complexity
    of the Roman Empire (Fig 1b). Since the empire spanned an area including 36 modern
    countries, we can correlate present and past complexity. When we do so, we find
    that ancient complexity is a marginally significant predictor of modern complexity,
    hinting that the structures of complexity -- whether they are due to geographical
    location or other exogenous factors -- survive even after millennia of history.

  Talk title: Harnessing Higher-Order Networks to Trace the Development of Doctrine
  Abstract: 'Modeling collections of historical documents as temporal citation networks
    allows us to investigate a wide range of dynamic phenomena, such as the diffusion
    of ideas or the formation of concepts. However, if the documents in question cover
    multiple topics and exhibit rich internal structure, the traditional modeling
    of documents as nodes and citations as directed edges discards too much relevant
    context to obtain nuanced insights. Motivated by the desire to understand how
    courts in different jurisdictions use existing case law to construct and support
    the legal reasoning communicated in their decisions, we propose to model a collection
    of documents as a directed temporal hypergraph, where each document is represented
    both as a node and as a set of directed hyperedges. Here, each hyperedge captures
    which documents are cited by a given document in the same context — e.g., in the
    same paragraph or to support the same argument —, and all nodes and hyperedges
    are associated with timestamps. This allows us to jointly leverage two order structures
    in our analyses: the partial order of hyperedges by inclusion and the total order
    of nodes and hyperedges by their timestamps. To this end, we introduce intuitive
    methods based on doubly temporal posets – i.e., partially ordered sets with temporal
    information on the sets as well as on the elements of the ground set –, with active
    posets recording how a document initially connects to an existing corpus, and
    passive posets recording how the document is subsequently integrated into the
    corpus. Our definitions allow us, inter alia, to compute refined versions of bibliographic
    coupling and co-citation that can be generalized to sets of nodes and sets of
    hyperedges, and to assess the temporal similarity of nodes or hyperedges based
    on the temporal structure of their active and passive posets. Our models and methods
    are readily applicable to all citation networks for which information on citation
    contexts is both relevant and available.'

  Talk title: A Sheaf Theoretic Approach to Near Space Network Routing
  Abstract: Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN), as a protocol suite for networked communications
    in space, is maturing into a viable enabling technology for the Solar System Internet
    (SSI). The goal for the SSI is to bring the reliability and efficiency gains of
    networking in terrestrial communications to all space communications. The focus
    of the SSI is now shifting towards the structural considerations in the use of
    DTN, as they pertain to it scaling to larger networks. The implications in the
    extension of these architectures to the scale of the solar system, and the best
    way to model them, are not well understood. This work attempts to address this
    gap in the mathematical foundations of this network and routing problem. We explore
    hypergraphs as faithful representations of network structure through sheaf theoretic
    routing models. In prior work the mathematical data structures known as sheaves
    proved useful for modeling general routing on graphs. Sheaves have seen much interest
    in application for their ability to formalize global agreement in topological
    spaces, given local information and verification. This is vital in our setting
    as current communication methods require global knowledge of the time-varying
    network, which is an infeasible constraint as the networks grow in size. The directed
    path sheaf, when applied to a directed graph, provides a description of locally
    verified paths, or routing sequences, between chosen vertices. Sheaves elucidate
    the dependencies of local to global information consistency within the structural
    confines of the space they are modeling in. Along these lines, we present what
    can be learned in the generalization of sheaf-theoretic routing models to hypergraphs,
    and further, the implications of generalizing routing from graphs to hypergraphs.
    In particular, the structures revealed in the global sections are more general
    than paths, introducing new questions about what routing should look like on these
    structures.
