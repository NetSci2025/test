  Talk title: Matrix-weighted networks for modeling multidimensional dynamics
  Abstract: 'Networks are powerful tools for modeling interactions in complex systems.
    While traditional networks use scalar edge weights, many real-world systems involve
    multidimensional interactions.For example, in social networks, individuals often
    have multiple interconnected opinions that can affect different opinions of other
    individuals, which can be better characterized by matrices.We propose a novel,
    general framework for modeling such multidimensional interacting dynamics: matrix-weighted
    networks (MWNs). We present the mathematical foundations of MWNs and examine consensus
    dynamics and random walks within this context. Our results reveal that the coherence
    of MWNs gives rise to non-trivial steady states that generalize the notions of
    communities and structural balance in traditional networks.'

  Talk title: Rumor propagation on hypergraphs
  Abstract: While much of research done on rumor and information propagation focuses
    on settings which are adequately described by traditional dyadic networks, namely
    micro-blogging social media, an increasing amount of communication in populous
    countries such as Brazil, India and Indonesia is exchanged via messenger mobile
    apps (such as Whatsapp and Telegram), which elude the simple network description
    since messages travel from group to group.To address this gap, we propose a rumor
    propagation model on hypergraphs suited to higher-order dynamics. Our model has
    three possible node states, ignorant (X), spreader (Y) and stifler (Z). An ignorant
    node becomes a spreader (contagion) with rate λ once one of its groups reached
    a critical mass of spreaders (defined with a threshold θ_λ), a mechanism  introduced
    before in related work. However, here we also keep track of how many groups reached
    the critical mass thus becoming active. Then, a spreader becomes a stifler (annihilation)
    with rate α once enough of their groups are active, which is controlled with a
    threshold θ_α.We conduct computational experiments to investigate the parameter
    space of the model and find that it reveals a rich variety of behaviors, with
    regions in the parameter space capable of exhibiting both spontaneous recovery
    (where the absorbing time τ decays exponentially) and group-mediated recovery
    (τ decays as a power-law of the contagion rate λ), depending on each node hyperdegree.
    The latter is seen on typical rumor propagation dynamics in the literature.Furthermore,
    we extend the study of the mechanisms proposed in our model by looking into two
    empirical datasets (Telegram, email-Eu). Considering aggregated statistics of
    interevent time and duration of information cascades, we compare simulations of
    our model on the empirical hypergraphs with the statistics from timestamps in
    the datasets and show that the parametric space is capable of capturing some of
    the temporal dynamics in the real-world systems.

  Talk title: Co-evolving Networks for Opinion and Social Dynamics in Agent-Based
    Models
  Abstract: Digital media has fundamentally transformed social interactions and reshaped
    the ways in which individual opinions influence and are influenced by these interactions
    [2]. While many studies explore how opinions influence social ties, existing models
    mostly fail to include the  interplay between opinion and social dynamics. We
    introduce a novel stochastic agent-based model (ABM) [1] that captures this co-evolutionary
    process. Our model considers agents moving in a social space influenced by both
    positions and opinions of other agents. Agents with similar opinions of the same
    stance exhibit social closeness, while opinion dissimilarity reinforces social
    distancing between agents. Opinion dynamics is driven by agents’ spatial proximity
    and their opinion similarity. By analyzing the underlying social and opinion temporal
    interaction networks, we explore the emergence of phenomena like echo chambers
    and opinion consensus [3]. We apply our model to  General Social Survey Data (GSS)
    [4],  demonstrating its ability to capture the co-evolution of political identity
    and individual opinions regarding governmental issues, see Figure. Our findings
    highlight the crucial role of this interplay in shaping social structures and
    collective outcomes.

  Talk title: Modeling opinion dynamics of LLM populations
  Abstract: As inherently social beings, humans possess the ability to form opinions
    based on their beliefs and communicate them with others. Opinion evolution in
    recent decades has been studied in the field of computational social sciences
    by creating agent-based models (ABMs) interacting and changing opinions according
    to different criteria. Despite the wide range of insights obtained, these models
    still suffer from limitations inherent to the mathematical approach, while recent
    approaches have included Large Language Models (LLMs) to overcome these issues.
    This preliminary work proposes a framework for allowing complex simulations with
    LLM agents. The framework builds upon ABMs, where a network connects agents interacting
    through multiple rounds of discussion. Each agent holds an opinion on a given
    input statement, quantified on a Likert scale ranging from 0 (strongly disagree)
    to 6 (strongly agree). Agents engaging in a discussion can be randomly chosen
    or decided according to an opinion dynamics algorithm. First tests with the framework
    were conducted in a mean-field scenario with 140 agents having different starting
    opinion distributions. Experiments leveraged Mistral-7B and Llama3 to simulate
    discussions on the Theseus’ Ship paradox, a thought experiment that forced agents
    into well-reasoned discussions, reducing the LLMs bias toward scientific truth.
    Preliminary results confirm the bias toward approval and excessive politeness
    by Mistral agents. On the other hand, Llama agents demonstrated instead to accept
    any opinion, with differences related to the scenario. Especially with a majority
    of negative opinions, agents tend to be more biased toward the negative side without
    reaching a positive stance. Moreover, Llama agents were mostly persuaded by fallacious
    statements (79% of cases), particularly in a polarized context.

  Talk title: Explicit exact solutions of the SI and Bass models on sparse random
    networks
  Abstract: In this work we present a new methodology for obtaining explicit expressions
    for the expected adoption or infection level in the Bass model for the diffusion
    of innovations and in the SI model for epidemics, respectively, on sparse networks
    with numerous cycles. Specifically, we obtain explicit expressions for sparse
    Erdos-Renyi networks and d-regular networks. These explicit expressions are solutions
    of first-order ordinary differential equations. As such, their properties are
    fairly easy to analyze. We stress that these expressions are exact, and not based
    on a mean-field or some other approximation.
