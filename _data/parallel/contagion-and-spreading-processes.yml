  Talk title: A generating-function approach to modelling complex contagion on clustered
    networks with multi-type branching processes
  Abstract: Understanding cascading processes on complex network topologies is paramount
    for modelling how diseases, information, fake news and other media spread. In
    this article, we extend the multi-type branching process method developed in Keating
    et al., (2022), which relies on networks having homogenous node properties, to
    a more general class of clustered networks. Using a model of socially inspired
    complex contagion we obtain results, not just for the average behaviour of the
    cascades but for full distributions of the cascade properties. We introduce a
    new method for the inversion of probability generating functions to recover their
    underlying probability distributions; this derivation naturally extends to higher
    dimensions. This inversion technique is used along with the multi-type branching
    process to obtain univariate and bivariate distributions of cascade properties.
    Finally, using clique-cover methods, we apply the methodology to synthetic and
    real-world networks and compare the theoretical distribution of cascade sizes
    with the results of extensive numerical simulations.

  Talk title: Group-Based Modeling Reveals the Critical Role of Heterogeneity and
    Hyperedge Overlap in Epidemic Processes with Higher-Order Interactions
  Abstract: In recent years, research has increasingly focused on understanding how
    higher-order interactions shape dynamical processes, particularly in contagion
    dynamics like the SIS model and its extensions. Studies have highlighted the role
    of the microscopic structure of higher-order interactions in determining the onset
    of epidemic outbreaks.This work introduces a group-based framework for the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered
    (SIR) process, incorporating higher-order interactions across groups of arbitrary
    size. The model explicitly accounts for heterogeneity in degree distributions
    and inter-order overlap—shared connectivity among hyperedges of different orders.
    By capturing these dynamical correlations, the framework addresses gaps in existing
    models, enabling detailed exploration of how heterogeneity and overlap influence
    contagion dynamics.For systems with 2- and 3-body interactions, the framework
    yields analytical expressions for the epidemic threshold. The results show that
    increasing inter-order overlap makes the system more prone to epidemic outbreaks.
    Remarkably, high heterogeneity in 2-body degree distributions counteracts this
    sensitivity. This effect stems from the interplay between pairwise and 3-body
    interaction dynamics, which the model disentangles analytically.The study also
    examines the final epidemic size and the temporal evolution of infections. A striking
    finding is that higher heterogeneity in group interactions can trigger explosive
    outbreaks, a phenomenon well-documented in SIS dynamics but previously unobserved
    in SIR processes. Specifically, while pairwise interactions lead to smooth transitions,
    3-body interactions exhibit abrupt and explosive growth as heterogeneity increases.These
    results underscore the importance of higher-order heterogeneity and dynamical
    correlations in shaping epidemic dynamics. By providing a versatile analytical
    framework, our model gives us new insights, deepening our understanding of complex
    contagion processes.

  Talk title: 'Votes or pathogens: A framework for detecting spreading phenomena on
    networks'
  Abstract: 'Models of spreading processes have been crucial for tackling a wide array
    of phenomena, from opinion formation to disease propagation. Such processes are
    arguably underpinned by fundamentally different mechanisms: in simple contagion,
    transmission occurs via contact with an infected neighbor, while in complex contagion
    it requires a level of consensus among neighbors. Despite huge advances in our
    understanding of spreading processes, our ability to assess the prevalence of
    underlying mechanisms from empirical data is limited. This is partly due to lack
    of data, but also due to the often non-trivial ways in which network topology
    interacts with the contagion dynamics on top. We propose a statistical inference
    framework for detecting the mechanisms underlying spreading phenomena.Our core
    assumption is that spreading mechanisms can be captured by matrices of infection
    and recovery rates that depend only on a node''s degree and the number of infected
    neighbors. Focusing on a set of basic infection mechanisms, our main contributions
    are two-fold. First, we assess the dynamic range of different processes, i.e.,
    the combined effect of network topology, parameters, sample size and initial conditions
    on our ability to identify mechanisms via statistical inference. Then, we infer
    which mechanisms explain the dynamics of three empirical datasets.Our results
    show that the detectability of spreading mechanisms is highly dependent on topology,
    infectivity, distribution of trials and sample size, including regimes where detection
    is highly unlikely. For example, for an SI model having many infected neighbors
    might lead to several infections and hinder detection, yet fewer infections mean
    that detection is possible. We also assess how the complete distribution of trials
    over time, including recovery events, can aid in the detectability of different
    processes, with the end goal of proposing estimators that account for regions
    of the dynamic range where inference is hindered.'

  Talk title: Decoding how higher-order network interactions shape complex contagion
    dynamics
  Abstract: Complex contagion models that involve contagion along higher-order structures,
    such assimplicial complexes and hypergraphs, yield new classes of mean-field models.
    Interestingly,the differential equations arising from many such models often exhibit
    a similar form, resultingin qualitatively comparable global bifurcation patterns.
    Motivated by this observation, weinvestigate a generalized mean-field-type model
    that provides a unified framework for analysinga range of different models. In
    particular, we derive analytical conditions for the emergence ofdifferent bifurcation
    regimes exhibited by three models of increasing complexity—ranging fromthree-
    and four-body interactions to two connected populations with both pairwise and
    three-body interactions. For the first two cases, we give a complete characterisation
    of all possibleoutcomes, along with the corresponding conditions on network and
    epidemic parameters. In thethird case, we demonstrate that multistability is possible
    despite only three-body interactions.Our results reveal that single population
    models with three-body interactions can only exhibitsimple transcritical transitions
    or bistability, whereas with four-body interactions multistabilitywith two distinct
    endemic steady states is possible. Surprisingly, the two-population modelexhibits
    multistability via symmetry breaking despite three-body interactions only. Our
    worksheds light on the relationship between equation structure and model behaviour
    and makes thefirst step towards elucidating mechanisms by which different system
    behaviours arise, and hownetwork and dynamic properties facilitate or hinder outcomes.

  Talk title: Disentangling epidemics and percolation
  Abstract: The susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) epidemic model and the bond
    percolation model are often treated as equivalent. However, this assumption is
    justified under certain conditions on transmission and recovery dynamics that
    are not necessarily realistic. In the general case, where recovery time can take
    multiple values, the isomorphism breaks down due to the correlated nature of epidemic
    propagation. For locally tree-like networks, the bond percolation scheme can still
    be used to accurately compute the epidemic threshold and the final epidemic size
    even though isomorphism cannot be assumed, but this agreement does not hold for
    general networks containing short cycles.To clarify the differences between the
    epidemic model and bond percolation, we construct a message passing formalism
    for the two models on tree-like and loopy networks. We note that this study is
    the first to formulate a message passing approach for the SIR epidemic model on
    general networks. Our approach highlights the conditions under which the two models
    are interchangeable and when one model can be a good approximation of the other.

  Talk title: Network spreading from network dimension
  Abstract: Many network spreading models are challenged by the global structural
    correlations typical of real complex networks. We consider mitigating this challenge
    via a network property ideally suited to capturing spreading. This is the network
    correlation dimension, a property capturing how the number of reachable nodes
    scales with network distance. Applying this approach to susceptible-infected-recovered
    processes leads to a simple model which, for a range of synthetic and empirical
    networks, can outperform models of substantially higher complexity in predicting
    the early stages of spreading. The proposed dimensional spreading model also provides
    a basic reproduction number offering new information about final system state.

  Talk title: What can we learn from modelling complex contagion on higher-order networks
    using birth-and-death processes?
  Abstract: Recent advances in network science have highlighted the importance of
    non-pairwise approaches to modelling complex systems, particularly in social and
    biological networks where interactions often extend beyond dyadic relationships.
    Despite valuable insights obtained via inclusion of higher-order mechanisms, theoretical
    studies in this direction remain scarce.We extend classical birth-death processes
    (BDPs) to include higher-order interactions for modelling complex contagion dynamics.
    Our framework incorporates simplicial complexes, introducing an additional parameter
    to capture multi-node interactions, such as 2-simplices, and is easily extendable
    to higher-order simplicial complexes. The exact model for fully connected networks
    gives rise to a Markov Chain which can be specified in terms of the forward Kolmogorov
    equations.Building on Crawford's general BDP framework, we demonstrate that infection
    rates, both pairwise and higher-order, can be reconstructed from simulation observations.
    Furthermore, using simulations, we distinguish between infections via pairwise
    and complex contagion routes and observe that often pairwise infections dominate
    at the start of an outbreak. However, later in the epidemic, complex contagion
    tends to dominate. Simulations reveal the significant roles of higher-order terms
    in epidemic dynamics, offering new insights into complex contagion on networks.
    Following on from the approach in the previous paper, we explore whether the rates
    of complex contagion can be learnt on networks other than fully connected. Furthermore,
    we explore how the properties of higher-order networks manifest in the shape of
    these rates with the view of developing a classifier.

  Talk title: Utility of Synthetic Epidemiological Data For Inferring Simulated SARS-CoV-2
    Superspread- ing Event
  Abstract: Superspreading events [1] have profoundly influenced the transmission
    dynamics of infectious disease outbreaks, in-cluding during the COVID-19 pandemic
    [2,3,4]. However, their sporadic nature makes prediction challenging. Theextensive
    genomic data collected during the pandemic presents an opportunity for retrospective
    analyses to identify thefactors driving these transmission patterns. This study
    evaluates a model integrating pairwise genetic and temporal dis-tances to infer
    transmission clusters associated with superspreading events via community detection
    algorithms. Syntheticdatasets with varying levels of stochasticity were utilised
    to assess the model’s performance in identifying superspreadingclusters and compare
    it to a recently published regression-based approach [5]. The results demonstrate
    that our proposedmodel has advantages in terms of simplicity, and under conditions
    of increasing epidemiological uncertainty and poorerquality data. Challenges such
    as low sampling density, high stochastic variability, and biased data can undermine
    cluster-ing performance and hinder the accurate identification of superspreading
    events. These findings underscore the criticalneed for comprehensive, high-resolution
    genomic and epidemiological data to enhance clustering accuracy and capturethe
    spatiotemporal transmission dynamics. We plan to apply this method with further
    refinement to datasets obtainedfrom Public Health Scotland [6] to characterise
    the spatiotemporal dynamics of superspreading and the factors drivingthis transmission
    pattern.
