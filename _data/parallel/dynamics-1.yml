  Talk title: Fundamental dynamics of popularity-similarity trajectories in real networks
  Abstract: Real networks are complex dynamical systems, evolving over time with the
    addition and deletion of nodes and links. Currently, there exists no principled
    mathematical theory for their dynamics---a grand-challenge open problem. In this
    talk, we will present our recent results setting the foundations for tackling
    this problem, published in PRL~[1]. (These results have been highlighted as an
    Editors' suggestion and featured in Physics~[2].)Specifically, we will show that
    the popularity and similarity trajectories of nodes in hyperbolic embeddings of
    different real networks manifest universal self-similar properties with typical
    Hurst exponents $H \ll 0.5$. This means that the trajectories are predictable,
    displaying anti-persistent or `mean-reverting' behavior, and they can be adequately
    captured by a fractional Brownian motion process, given by Eq.~(\ref{eq:rlfbm_main}):\begin{equation}\label{eq:rlfbm_main}\tilde{B}_H(t)=B_0+\int_{0}^{t}\mu(s)\mathrm{d}s+\frac{1}{\Gamma{(H+\frac{1}{2})}}\int_{0}^{t}(t-s)^{H-1/2}\sigma(s)\mathrm{d}B(s),~~t
    \geq 0.\end{equation}In the above relation, $B(s)$ is the standard Brownian motion,
    $B_0$ is the initial position, $H \in (0,1)$ is the Hurst exponent, $\Gamma$ is
    the gamma function, and $\mu(s)$ and $\sigma(s)$ are respectively the trend and
    noise-induced volatility at time $s$. As an example, Fig.~\ref{pop_clt}  shows
    the popularity trajectory of the Charlotte Douglas International Airport (CLT)
    in the US Air transportation network. The observed behavior can be qualitatively
    reproduced in synthetic networks that possess a latent geometric space, but not
    in networks that lack such space~[1], suggesting that the observed subdiffusive
    dynamics are inherently linked to the hidden geometry of real networks.  We will
    also briefly discuss ongoing work of how to predict link kinetics in real networks,
    once the historical evolution of node connectivity and popularity-similarity trajectories
    are known.

  Talk title: Fluid flow through the lacunocanalicular network in bone
  Abstract: The bones of most animals, including humans, are permeated by two nested
    network structures. The lacunocanalicular network (LCN) consists of pores, called
    lacunae, interconnected by channels, called canaliculi. The lacunae accommodate
    the cell bodies of osteocytes, with their cell processes extending through the
    canaliculi. Multiple functions are attributed to the LCN and the osteocyte network,
    including facilitating transport and signaling, and potentially playing a critical
    role in mechanosensing and the orchestration of bone remodeling. According to
    the fluid flow hypothesis, bone deformation from physical activity results in
    load-induced fluid flow through the LCN. This flow generates shear and drag forces,
    which can be sensed by osteocytes.To investigate these processes, we have developed
    an experimental and computational workflow which allows us to (a) image the three-dimensional
    architecture of the LCN; (b) quantify the architecture of the spatial network
    and (c) calculate the fluid flow through the network. We use confocal laser scanning
    microscopy to capture high-resolution images of the LCN. A custom-made software
    is then used to transform the image data into a mathematical network of nodes
    and edges. Hydraulic circuit theory can further be applied to calculate the fluid
    flow velocity in each canaliculus.In our study, we investigate the fluid flow
    through the LCN in human osteons, the basic cylindrical building blocks of cortical
    bone. Our aim is to characterize how aging of bone and the occurrence of micropetrosis,
    i.e. the mineralization of lacunae after osteocyte death, influence the fluid
    flow through the LCN. To achieve this, we systematically “close” specific lacunae
    in our computational model and analyze how these changes influence the fluid flow
    pattern. Our analysis should clarify the resilience of the LCN - in clinical terms,
    how much micropetrosis contributes to a reduced mechanosensation of osteonal bone
    as we age.

  Talk title: Mapping memory-biased random walks reveals overlapping communities
  Abstract: Overlapping communities capture the complexity of real-world networks,
    where nodes often play diverse roles across various contexts. However, identifying
    overlapping flow-based communities requires path or other higher-order data, which
    is commonly unavailable. To address this challenge, we draw inspiration from the
    representation-learning algorithm node2vec and employ memory-biased random walks
    to approximate higher-order dynamics. But instead of explicitly simulating the
    walks, we model them with sparse memory networks and control the complexity of
    the higher-order model with an information-theoretic approach through a tunable
    information-loss parameter. Using the map equation framework, we partition the
    resulting higher-order networks into overlapping modules. To validate the efficacy
    of our proposed approach, we conducted extensive experiments and conclude that
    this method captures overlapping flow-based communities in both synthetic and
    real-world networks.

  Talk title: Time-dependent influence metric for cascade dynamics on networks
  Abstract: An algorithm for efficiently calculating the expected size of single-seed
    cascade dynamics on networks is proposed and tested. The expected size is a time-dependent
    quantity and so enables the identification of nodes who are the most influential
    early or late in the spreading process. The measure is accurate for both critical
    and subcritical dynamic regimes and so generalises the nonbacktracking centrality
    that was previously shown to successfully identify the most influential single
    spreaders in a model of critical epidemics on networks.

  Talk title: Learning interpretable collective variables for dynamical systems on
    networks
  Abstract: Collective variables (CVs) are low-dimensional projections of high-dimensional
    system states. They can be used to gain insights into complex emergent dynamical
    behaviors of processes on networks. The relation between CVs and network measures
    is not well understood and its derivation typically requires detailed knowledge
    of both the dynamical system and the network topology. In this work, we present
    a data-driven method for algorithmically learning and understanding CVs for binary-state
    spreading processes on networks of arbitrary topology. Our results deliver evidence
    for the existence of low-dimensional CVs even in cases that are not yet understood
    theoretically.

  Talk title: Excitability and stochastic effects in an experimental spiking laser
    network
  Abstract: 'The collective dynamics of spiking elements is of particular interest
    due to its prominence in both neuroscience and for applications in the context
    of physics-based neuromorphic computing. Here, we present experimental and analytical
    results of a network of up to 500 semiconductor lasers with non-linear optoelectronic
    feedback.  We can tune the network configuration from one to all to globally coupled.  A
    key feature of this system is that the coupling takes place through the slowly
    evolving electronic signal - our experimental setup can be seen as a network with
    adaptive coupling.The system is modelled by a set of stochastic differential equations
    with three different time scales: the fast (optical) time scales describe the
    semiconductor laser dynamics and the slow time scale describes the electronic
    signal in the feedback loop. We consider independent additive noise terms in the
    nodes - this noise is based on spontaneous emission noise. We also include noise
    in the adaptive coupling - this electronic noise is common for the whole network.The
    individual nodes are not excitable; however, with sum-coupling the network becomes
    excitable as its size increases.  We study experimentally and numerically the
    excitable character of the network, by recording the response to an external perturbation.
    We show that increasing the network size has a stabilizing effect on the excitability,
    making the response more consistent, when only considering noise in each node.
    However, such effect is not reproduced in the experiment. We find that the inclusion
    of electronic noise in the coupling counteracts this effect, and reproduces the
    experimental data. We explain the interplay of the network dynamics, noise in
    the nodes and noise in the adaptive coupling in framework of slow-fast dynamics,
    and the existence of a sepatrix in phase space.'

  Talk title: Interplay Between Structure and Diffusion Dynamics in Random and Multiplex
    Networks
  Abstract: 'Network structure and dynamical processes on networks are highly correlated
    and remain a central topic in network science. Diffusion dynamics serve as a key
    process in studying this interplay due to the model''s simplicity. Despite this,
    few theoretical results are available. In this work, we investigate the role of
    network structure in determining the algebraic connectivity, the second-smallest
    eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix, which quantifies the diffusion time in complex
    networks.In [Gomez, Sergio, et al. 2013], an interesting behavior was observed
    in diffusive processes on multiplex networks: in certain cases, the diffusion
    time of a multiplex network can be smaller than that of any of its isolated layers.
    This phenomenon, known as super-diffusion, has since inspired numerous efforts
    to understand and characterize it. For the first time, in [Torres-Hugas, Lluís,
    et. al. 2024], we provided an analytical description of this phenomenon, offering
    new insights and establishing bounds for the super-diffusion region in the connectivity
    space k1 - k2 of random duplex networks.Building on this recent result, we present
    a new comprehensive analysis of diffusion in networks with indirect connections.
    Indirect connections in networks allow the spread of information between two nodes,
    i and k, that are not directly connected but are connected through a third node
    j, in a path of length two. This new diffusion channel allows the spread of information
    between nodes i and k without necessarily involving j. In this study, we are able
    to obtain an analytical description of the phase diagram of the indirect influence—a
    new parameter to quantify how the introduction of indirect diffusive channels
    enhances the diffusion process—in random networks using perturbation theory. Moreover,
    we find a new topological phase transition in the abundance of indirect channels
    for a critical connection probability.'
