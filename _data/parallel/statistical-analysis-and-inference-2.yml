  Talk title: Partial Information Decomposition in Networks of Random Processes
  Abstract: Understanding how information is distributed in network systems composed
    by multiple interacting nodes is a crucial problem in many scientific fields.
    Partial information decomposition (PID) constitutes a comprehensive framework
    decomposing the mutual information (MI) that a target random variable shares with
    a set of source variables into components highlighting how such an information
    is distributed among the sources, i.e., the unique information exclusively available
    from each source, the redundant information that can be obtained from at least
    two different sources, and the synergistic information that is revealed only when
    multiple sources are considered simultaneously. Since it has been specifically
    defined for random variables, applying the PID to multivariate time series representing
    realizations of a vector random process composed by several source processes and
    a target process may be confounding. In this case, the PID would decompose the
    information shared by the processes at the same time, thus implicitly disregarding
    the temporal statistical structure of the multivariate process. To overcome this
    issue, in this work we formalize a partial information rate decomposition (PIRD)
    for networks of stationary random processes exhibiting nontrivial temporal correlations,
    leveraging the use of entropy rates as basic elements of information decomposition.
    We show that the presence of temporal correlations has a profound impact on the
    multivariate information shared at lag zero by multiple random processes. Moreover,
    exploiting the formalism that connects information rates with linear Gaussian
    regression models and spectral quantities, we provide a joint time and frequency
    domain formulation of the PIRD which highlights distinct high-order behaviors
    of oscillatory rhythms.

  Talk title: 'A Non-Parametric Bayesian Approach to Partial Rankings: Parsimonious
    Inference in Sparse Data Regimes'
  Abstract: Pairwise ranking models are widely used in domains such as sports analytics,
    recommendation systems, and the study of social hierarchies to compare entities
    and derive meaningful insights. Since the pairwise comparisons inherently involve
    some degree of uncertainty due to randomness, noise, or incomplete information
    in the observed outcomes, these models are generally formulated as probabilistic
    models whose parameters can then be inferred given a dataset. However, in situations
    with limited or incomplete data, it may be difficult to confidently distinguish
    between players with similar performance. A shortcoming of many pairwise ranking
    methods is that they do not inherently account for this sparsity in the data in
    a nonparametric way, i.e., they do not automatically adjust the number of rankings
    based on the amount of evidence available. We address this issue by introducing
    a probabilistic generative model that intrinsically incorporates partial rankings
    ---rankings where multiple nodes can have the same rank--- in its generative process.
    This allows us to account for the uncertainty introduced by sparsity in the data
    by grouping players into the same rank when the data does not provide enough evidence
    to separate them. Our method is fully Bayesian and can, in principle, accommodate
    any ranking method. We provide a fast nonparametric agglomerative algorithm to
    infer the partial rankings, and by fitting our model to a wide range of synthetic
    and real-world datasets, we find that it can often provide a more parsimonious
    description of the data under sparse regimes. As a case study, we apply our method
    to a faculty hiring network amongst Computer Science departments in US universities.
    The picture that emerges is that of a well-separated hierarchy dominated by a
    small group of elite universities with very little upward mobility across the
    rankings.

  Talk title: Inference accuracy of loopy belief propagation in Ising and percolation
    models
  Abstract: Belief propagation (BP) is a message passing algorithm widely employed
    to solve inference problems in probabilistic graphical models such as percolation
    models, Ising spin models, and Bayesian networks. While BP computes marginal probabilities
    exactly on tree networks, it also provides good approximations in non-tree networks
    containing cycles, contributing to its versatility. However, the accuracy of BP
    in non-tree networks varies greatly depending on the network structure, and this
    dependency has not yet been fully clarified.This research aims to investigate
    the performance of BP in non-tree network structures, identifying key factors
    that influence its accuracy. Using bond percolation and Ising model as examples,
    we measure the errors of BP predictions by comparing them with Monte Carlo simulation
    results in various real-world networks. We identify two major sources of error
    in BP.One source of error is the finite size of the system, which becomes significant
    in small networks. The conventional BP method exhibits sharp changes in the order
    parameter so that it fails to capture the smooth transitions in small networks.
    We demonstrate that a simple modification to the BP algorithm can significantly
    reduce this finite-size error without compromising computational efficiency.The
    other source of error arises from the discrepancy between the BP equation and
    the actual non-tree structure. This is the error that remains even after reducing
    the finite-size error using our modified BP. We show how the quality of BP's approximations
    relates to different topological properties, such as degree distributions, clustering
    coefficients, shortest path lengths, and non-backtracking matrix spectra.Our findings
    provide insights into the relationship between the applicability of BP and the
    network structures. This understanding may help develop more accurate and efficient
    BP algorithms for various non-tree networks.

  Talk title: Regionalization via nonparametric community detection in spatially embedded
    networks
  Abstract: A central question in the study of human mobility concerns how spatial
    constraints shape individual and collective behavior. To this end, many macroscopic
    modeling approaches highlight the role of distance, while microscopic models often
    rely on individual characteristics of locations to predict mobility patterns.
    A growing body of work also focuses on mesoscopic patterns, such as geographic/social
    boundaries between regions or regions with disproportionately high visitation---phenomena
    that often cannot be captured under standard micro/macroscopic modeling applications.
    Although existing methods for studying mesoscopic structure in non-spatial data
    have been used to study interregional mobility flows, these methods do not incorporate
    the distance between locations, which is known to play an important role. Therefore,
    we introduce an inferential technique for defining mesoscopic regions that directly
    incorporates spatial patterns, based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle.
    Our Bayesian generative model is a modification of the stochastic block model
    (SBM). The standard SBM assumes a random network as a null model, which may be
    a suboptimal choice for spatial data because the block structure will build regions
    using purely spatial patterns. Instead, we build a notion of distance directly
    into the SBM, allowing the model to disentangle regional effects from macroscopic
    patterns. To do this, we use the distance between nodes in the planar adjacency
    graph, formed by linking regions that share a border. We implement an MCMC sampling
    algorithm that allows us to fit the model to data.We evaluate our method on synthetic
    and empirical data. Then, we compare its output to that of other regionalization
    methods in a number of synthetic and experimental settings. Our model can be used
    as a principled way of defining regions based on human behavioral data, which
    could be used for a number of downstream analysis tasks.

  Talk title: Latent Space Network Modeling with Covariate Selection
  Abstract: 'Latent space (LS) modeling provides a framework for analyzing networks
    in which nodes are positioned in LS, and the distance between nodes determines
    their connection probability. This approach simplifies statistical modeling, ensuring
    dyadic independence of edges conditional on node positions and capturing network
    features such as clustering via the geometry of the LS. Node and edge covariates
    are often incorporated to inform node positioning; however, assuming all preselected
    covariates are informative is unrealistic. Including extraneous covariates can
    induce bias while reducing estimate precision, particularly in sparse network
    settings, where covariate information contributes a relatively larger portion
    of the overall likelihood. Robust methods for covariate selection are thus critical.We
    extend the framework by Zhang et al., which models the network and node covariates
    jointly as a function of LS, with two contributions: incorporating a group lasso
    procedure for covariate regression coefficients and integrating adaptive gradient
    descent for efficient LS position estimation. These additions automate covariate
    selection while improving computational efficiency.Through simulations, we compare
    our enhanced method to the framework by Zhang et al. and a baseline model that
    estimates LS positions using network data alone. Our method is comparable when
    all covariates are informative and outperforms both other approaches as the number
    of noninformative covariates increases. Importantly, this improvement in covariate
    selection does not degrade the accuracy of network estimation.The proposed enhancements
    provide an efficient and effective framework for incorporating covariate information
    in network studies. By leveraging adaptive gradient descent and group lasso regularization,
    our method improves model robustness and accuracy, particularly in the presence
    of non-informative covariates, while maintaining the interpretability and flexibility
    of LS models.'

  Talk title: Assessing the interdependence of climate tipping elements
  Abstract: The study of Earth’s dynamics poses significant challenges from methodological
    and experimental viewpoints. Network science provides an ideal framework to gain
    insights into the complexityof Earth’s climatology. However, usual approaches
    do not properly address the uncertainty from observational data to infer the underlying
    functional connectivity. Traditional methods, such asthresholding, often result
    in significant information loss and the introduction of spurious connections.
    Here, we employ a Bayesian approach to reconstruct the dynamics of a climatic
    networkusing historical reanalysis data from 1970 and future climatic projections
    until 2100. We utilize temperature and precipitation data, analyzing both historical
    and projected CMIP6 data for lowand high emission scenarios.Our analysis reveals
    that the network of structural connectivity has significantly changed in recentdecades
    and will undergo abrupt shifts in the future in a scenario of high emissions.
    We focus onthe interdependency among tipping points and find that the intensity
    of their teleconnections isdecreasing over time compared to the 1970s. The role
    of the Atlantic Meridional OverturningCirculation (AMOC) is crucial in contributing
    to this effect, aligning with recent findings suggestingthat this region is on
    a tipping course. These results are robust over past decades, with deviationsfrom
    the baseline becoming more profound in future years under high-emission scenarios,
    thus callingfor a global effort to mitigate the impact of human activities on
    the environment.
