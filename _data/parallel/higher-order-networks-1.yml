  Talk title: Exploiting the higher-order structure of treatment-trial networks in
    network meta-analysis
  Abstract: Network meta-analysis (NMA) is a method to synthesize evidence from multiple
    clinical trials comparing treatments for the same condition. The method derives
    its name from a graphical representation of the data where nodes are treatments,
    and edges represent comparisons between treatments in trials.1 However, traditional
    NMA graphs are limited to pairwise comparisons and fail to represent higher-order
    structures introduced by trials comparing more than two treatments. In reality,
    NMA networks are hypergraphs with hyperedges (trials) that connect two or more
    nodes (treatments) at once. They can be represented naturally as bipartite structures
    where trials define a second type of node, and edges represent the arms of a trial,
    connecting trial nodes to the treatment nodes they compare. An example is shown
    in Fig 1(i).The bipartite structure of NMA and its potential insights have been
    noted recently,2,3 but have yet to be explored in practice. In this work, I formalise
    the bipartite framework for NMA and use this to examine the flow of information
    through the network. Understanding how evidence from different trials combines
    to estimate treatment effects is a key challenge for NMA. Previously, we showed
    that the `flow of evidence' on the traditional NMA graph can be interpreted in
    terms of the movement of a random walk (RW) on its edges.4 However, it is not
    clear how these flows relate to the contributions of individual trials. To address
    this limitation, I introduce a RW on the bipartite NMA graph. As shown in Fig
    1(ii), this approach reveals how evidence flows through the arms of the trials.
    Using a two-step higher-order RW model,5 I demonstrate that the evidence flows
    on the traditional NMA graph can also be derived from a RW on the bipartite network.
    This work represents the first application of higher-order network theory in the
    context of NMA, providing new insights into the evidence structure and establishing
    a foundation for future methodological advancements.

  Talk title: Explosive Cooperation in Social Dilemmas on Higher-Order Networks
  Abstract: Understanding how cooperative behaviors can emerge from competitive interactions
    is an open problem in biology and social sciences. While interactions are usually
    modeled as pairwise networks, the units of many real-world systems can also interact
    in groups of three or more. Here, we introduce a general framework to extend pairwise
    games to higher-order networks. By studying social dilemmas on hypergraphs with
    a tunable structure, we find an explosive transition to cooperation triggered
    by a critical number of higher-order games. The associated bistable regime implies
    that an initial critical mass of cooperators is also required for the emergence
    of prosocial behavior. Our results show that higher-order interactions provide
    a novel explanation for the survival of cooperation.

  Talk title: The relevance of higher-order ties
  Abstract: Higher-order networks effectively represent complex systems with group
    interactions. Existing methods usually overlook therelative contribution of group
    interactions (hyperlinks) of different sizes to the overall network structure.
    Yet, this has manyimportant applications, especially when the network has meaningful
    node labels. In this work, we propose a comprehensive methodology to precisely
    measure the contribution of different orders to the overall network structure.
    First, we propose the order contribution measure, which quantifies the contribution
    of hyperlinks of different orders to the link weights (local scale), number of
    triangles (mesoscale) and size of the largest connected component (global scale)
    of the pairwise weighted network. Second, we propose the measure of order relevance,
    which gives insights in how hyperlinks of different orders contribute to the considered
    network property. Most interestingly, it enables an assessment of whether this
    contribution is synergistic or redundant with respect to that of hyperlinks of
    other orders. Third, to account for labels, we propose a metric of label group
    balance to assess how hyperlinks of different orders connect label-induced groups
    of nodes. We applied these metrics to a large-scale board interlock network and
    scientific collaboration network, in which node labels correspond to geographical
    location of the nodes. Experiments including a comparison with randomized null
    models reveal how from the global level perspective, we observe synergistic contributions
    of orders in the board interlock network, whereas in the collaboration network
    there is more redundancy. The findings shed new light on social scientific debates
    on the role of busy directors in globalbusiness networks and the connective effects
    of large author teams in scientific collaboration networks.

  Talk title: The Effects of Higher-Order Structures in Social Systems
  Abstract: 'Higher-order mathematical structures, such as hypergraphs, offer versatile
    modeling capabilities surpassing traditional graph models limited to binary relations
    between entities. Their adoption is motivated by the observation that real-world
    scenarios often entail interactions among multiple entities. Directed hypergraphs
    further enhance modeling by representing relations between sets of nodes.Random
    graph null models are key tools in graph theory because they allow us to assess
    the significance of observed properties and identify structural irregularities.
    Despite a vast literature on graph ensembles, little attention has been devoted
    to defining null models for directed hypergraphs and developing efficient algorithms
    for sampling from them. Developing null models for directed hypergraphs brings
    unique challenges due to their intricate entity relations, characterized by a
    broader set of properties. Parameters such as the number of nodes, number of hyperedges,
    head and tail sizes, and frequency of nodes within hyperedge heads or tails should
    be considered.We study two micro-canonical null models and propose two efficient
    Markov Chain Monte Carlo samplers based on Metropolis-Hastings. We demonstrate
    the interdisciplinary applicability of our samplers by showcasing three use cases
    in sociology, epidemiology, and economics, respectively: (i) we show the role
    of higher-order structures in quantifying political group homophily by uncovering
    an oscillatory behavior of increased homophily in opposition parties in the US
    Congress across 40 years, (ii) we demonstrate that the disparities observed between
    simulations of nonlinear SIS contagion processes in hyper-networks and theoretical
    predictions can be explained when considering the higher-order joint degree distribution,
    and (iii) we show that the main structural economic complexity indexes of countries
    can be explained by local properties of the global trade network preserved by
    the null models.'

  Talk title: Phase Transitions in the Simplicial Ising Model on Hypergraphs
  Abstract: Here, we study the phase transitions in the simplicial Ising model on
    hypergraphs, originally proposed in [1], in which the energy within each hyperedge
    (group) is lowered only when all the member spins are unanimously aligned. The
    Hamiltonian of the model is equivalent to a weighted sum of lower-order interactions,
    evoking an Ising model defined on a simplicial complex. Using the Landau free
    energy approach within the mean-field theory, we identify diverse phase transitions
    depending on the sizes of hyperedges [2]. Specifically, when all hyperedges have
    the same size $q$, the nature of the transitions shifts from continuous to discontinuous
    at the tricritical point $q=4$, with the transition temperatures varying nonmonotonically,
    revealing the ambivalent effects of group size $q$. Furthermore, if both pairwise
    edges and hyperedges of size $q>2$ coexist in a hypergraph, novel scenarios emerge,
    including mixed-order and double transitions, particularly for $q>8$. Adopting
    the Bethe--Peierls method, we investigate the interplay between pairwise and higher-order
    interactions in achieving global magnetization, illuminating the multiscale nature
    of the higher-order dynamics. See the attached PDF for more details.[1] T. Robiglio,

  Talk title: Unifying higher-order sequence models with simplicial complexes, cell
    complexes, and hypergraphs.   De Bruijn graphs as combinatorial complexes and
    their topological neural networks.
  Abstract: We contribute to the unification \cite{10.1038/s41567-019-0459-y} of higher-order
    network models by unifying higher-order sequence models with combinatorial complexes.The
    network science community, joining forces with algebraic topology, has made significant
    progress in bridging simplicial complexes, cell complexes, and hypergraphs by
    unifying them as combinatorial complexes \cite{10.48550/arXiv.2206.00606}.A notable
    exception to this unification is higher-order sequence models.\cite{10.1145/3097983.3098145}
    used De Bruijn graphs to construct higher-order and multi-order network models
    of sequences and temporal graphs.We develop a framework to show that these higher-order
    and multi-order network models can be represented as combinatorial complexes using
    higher-order tensors.Our framework broadens the applications of higher-order networks,
    topological data analysis, and topological deep learning communities to sequence
    data.We use this unified framework to develop neural network-based generative
    multi-order network models of sequences and generalize existing De Bruijn graph
    neural networks \cite{10.48550/arXiv.2406.16552}.

  Talk title: The microscale organization of directed hypergraphs
  Abstract: 'Traditional network models focus on pairwise connections between nodes,
    neglecting the complexities of systems where multiple units interact simultaneously.
    Hypergraphs provide a framework for explicitly encoding higher-order interactions,
    representing them as hyperedges connecting multiple nodes simultaneously. By preserving
    group-based interactions, they improve our ability to understand the structures
    and dynamics of systems with many-body interactions. Most research has so far
    focused on undirected hypergraphs, which fail to capture the directional nature
    of many real-world interactions. For example, in a metabolic reaction, a set of
    reactants transforms into a set of products. Directed hypergraphs enhance modeling
    by distinguishing between source and target sets in hyperedges. In this work,
    we introduce measures and tools to characterize the microscale organization of
    real-world directed hypergraphs. First, we discuss a decomposition into fundamental
    interaction types: one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one and many-to-many. We analyze
    empirical data to count the occurrences of each interaction type, and use this
    information as a signature to compute differences in higher-order connectivity
    patterns. Second, we propose new simple and computationally efficient definitions
    for reciprocity for directed hypergraphs, namely exact, strong and weak higher-order
    reciprocity, designed to capture different patterns of bi-directionality in empirical
    data. Finally, we extend motif analysis to identify recurring interaction patterns
    and extract the building blocks of directed hypergraphs. We validate our framework
    on empirical datasets (Bitcoin transactions, e-mails, forum discussions, metabolic
    and citation data) revealing structural principles behind the organization of
    real-world systems, including the existence of mechanisms of feedback and reinforcement
    in the information flow among system units, where pairwise interactions support
    the action of groups, and vice versa.'

  Talk title: Modeling networks motifs as higher-order interactions
  Abstract: Synchronization is relevant in a wide range of disciplines. This phenomenon
    is commonly studied using the Kuramoto model, which describes the dynamics of
    a system of coupled oscillators with varying natural frequencies and sinusoidal
    coupling. In electric power systems, the synchronization of generators is essential
    for ensuring a reliable supply of electricity. The generator's dynamics is described
    by a second order Kuramoto model where the sinusoidal coupling term gives the
    flow of real power across transmission lines. Stable operation requires that phases
    are locked and phase differences across lines must be below a certain bound $\gamma$,
    a condition referred to as phase cohesiveness. Hence, it is of utmost interest
    to understand when a network supports a phase cohesive state and when it does
    not.In this contribution we introduce a novel approach to the synchronization
    and phase cohesiveness problem based on mapping the fixed point equations to a
    convex optimization problem. This approach allows us to systematically compute
    all synchronized states where the phase difference across an edge does not exceed
    $\pi/2$, including exotic states with loop flows. Furthermore, our approach sheds
    light onto the  commonly used ``DC'' approximation, where the sinusoidal coupling
    function is linearized. We derive rigorous bounds on the error introduced by the
    linear approximation, obtaining a region of trust for individual lines. Based
    on these results, we find a rigorous sufficient condition on the existence of
    phase cohesive states that holds regardless of the underlying network topology.
    We demonstrate our results for an adapted Matpower 30-bus test case.
