  Talk title: Functional reducibility of higher-order networks
  Abstract: '(Full abstract in PDF) Higher-order networks encode more information
    than pairwise interactions: for example, some metabolic reactions can only take
    place if three or more reactants are present, but this information would not be
    captured by pairwise interactions.However, this modeling flexibility comes at
    a cost: new data needs to be adequately recorded, and new analytical andcomputational
    tools need to be developed. Moreover, the complexity and computational cost of
    these tools increaseexponentially as larger group interactions are considered.
    It is therefore crucial to understand under which conditionshigher-order representations
    need to be favored over classical pairwise ones.Here [2], we propose a principled
    approach to optimally compress systems with higher-order interactions—accounting
    for the complexity of the data and the complexity of the model. Specifically,
    we determine an optimal order of interactions up to which interactions need be
    considered to obtain a functionally optimal representation of the system—larger
    orders can be safely discarded.Formally, we do so by generalizing the concept
    of network density matrix [3] to account for higher-order diffusivedynamics with
    the multiorder Laplacian [4] and calculate a (modified) message length corresponding
    to each order.By minimizing this message length, in the spirit of the original
    minimum message length principle, we find the optimalcompression of the data.
    We refer to this procedure as functional reduction. A higher-order network is
    fully reducible—to a pairwise network—if the optimal order is 1, while its reducibility
    decreases for increasing optimal orders. We demonstrate the validity of our method
    by performing an extensive analysis of synthetic networks and investigate the
    functional reducibility of a broad spectrum of real-world higher-order systems.'

  Talk title: Stronger together? The homophily trap in networks
  Abstract: 'While homophily---the tendency to link with similar others---may nurture
    a sense of belonging and shared values, it can also hinder diversity and widen
    inequalities. Here, we unravel this trade-off analytically, revealing homophily
    traps for minority groups: scenarios where increased homophilic interaction among
    minorities negatively affects their structural opportunities within a network.
    We demonstrate that homophily traps arise when minority size falls below 25% of
    a network, at which point homophily comes at the expense of lower structural visibility
    for the minority group. Our work reveals that social groups require a critical
    size to benefit from homophily without incurring structural costs, providing insights
    into core processes underlying the emergence of group inequality in networks.'

  Talk title: Community Structure in Markov Influence Graphs with Heterogeneous Holding
    Times
  Abstract: Uncovering the community structure within complex networks is key to understanding
    their functional units, dynamics, and organizational patterns. However, popular
    community detection approaches like modularity optimization are NP-hard and sensitive
    to initial conditions. The KDA, based on the Markov Influence Graph (MIG) framework,
    offers a deterministic, polynomial-time solution. Currently, both the KDA algorithm
    and the fundamental analysis of MIGs rely on long-run characteristics of random
    walkers in discrete time, such that each random walker spends an equal amount
    of time at each node. In this paper, we extend the model to a continuous time
    model by allowing for the random walker to spend heterogeneous times at nodes.
    For example, in a social network, each agent (node) may take varying amounts of
    time to pass on or process a piece of information (i.e., the random walker), meaning
    the walker can spend different time durations at different nodes. Through both
    simulation and empirical applications, we demonstrate that incorporating a time
    dimension significantly impacts the community structure of a network. Our algorithm
    offers wide-ranging applications, from social sciences, economics, and finance
    to the natural sciences, providing a new lens for exploring complex systems.

  Talk title: Can driving mechanisms of contact duration distributions be distinguished?
  Abstract: 'Human contact networks such as face-to-face interaction, email exchange,
    and phone communication often display power-law contact duration distributions
    with potential cutoffs. One class of models associate each contact with a time-independent
    persistent probability η, leading to an exponentially decaying probability distribution
    for individual contact durations with a given η. The observed long tail in the
    marginal distribution is an aggregate effect of the contact persistence distribution
    ρ(η), which may arise from various factors. Another class of models accounts for
    self-reinforcement of agents, i.e., “the longer an agent interacts with a group,
    the less likely it is to leave”. In these models, the contact persistence probability
    η(t) is a function of the time t, and an increasing η(t) leads to a contact duration
    distribution that intrinsically decays slower than exponentially. The two classes
    of models represent two different generative mechanisms: (I) aggregate effect
    of time homogeneous processes, versus (II) intrinsic time-heterogeneous processes.In
    this study, we analytically discuss the two model classes and reveal their mathematical
    relationship. Moreover, we aim to examine whether it is possible to empirically
    distinguish which mechanism is truly at work, when both mechanisms can produce
    the same observed contact duration data. This task is non-trivial because it is
    impossible to distinguish the two mechanisms by controlling the time t and observing
    the conditional persistence probability. To this end, we analyse two datasets
    of human-LLM (Large Language Model) conversations where the content of multi-turn
    interactions between humans and LLMs is recorded, as well as four human face-to-face
    interaction networks. The survival modeling framework will be used in an attempt
    to distinguish between the two mechanisms. To this end, Bayesian inference will
    be used, as it allows for the quantification of evidence for or against the two
    competing mechanisms.'

  Talk title: Vector-borne multiscale models encompassing mobility and climate features
  Abstract: 'Due to both international trade and travels as well as climate change,
    temperate areas in the Americas and in themediterranean basin are now at risk
    of future significant and recurrent vector-borne epidemics. Meanwhile, mathe-matical
    modeling of vector-borne diseases progressively acknowledged the interplay between
    epidemics and human mobility or between epidemics and climate on spatially distributed
    models due to ever-growing data availability. However, vector-borne disease models
    encompassing both climate dependence and multi-scale mobility are still missing
    to accurately forecast vector-borne epidemics in temperate areas. Here we introduce
    and compare two multiscale reaction-diffusion metapopulation models based on ordinary
    differential equations which differ in the modeling of human mobility: one integrating
    it into the force of infection, the other using a diffusion pattern. Both models
    encompass a tunable time-scale separation between human mobility and the epidemics,
    short-range vector mobility, human-mediated vector mobility (e.g. vectors in cars),
    long-range human mobility due to airline traffic and climate dependency in the
    demographic and epidemiological parameters. Through exhaustive computational analysis,
    we assess the impact of mobility features on the emergence of epidemics in the
    two models on synthetic and real-world networks. We show that systems below the
    epidemics threshold can undergo significant epidemics due to mobility and that
    the modeling choice of the latter has a dramatic impact on the emergence and magnitude
    of the epidemics across spatial and temporal scales. We explain analytically the
    behavior of the force of infection model using perturbation analysis and discuss
    the comparative relevance of both models. Then, to study the emergence of those
    disease in temperate areas we will establish risk maps for dengue epidemics in
    Italy according to several climate change scenarios, based on demographic, mobility
    and epidemiological data.'
