  Talk title: 'Networking drones of different feathers: the secret sauce for flocking'
  Abstract: The study of flocking in biological systems has identified conditions
    for self-organized collective behavior, inspiring the development of decentralized
    strategies to coordinate the dynamics of swarms of drones and other autonomous
    vehicles [1]. Previous research has predominantly focused on the role of the interaction
    network while assuming identical or nearly identical agents, owing to the widely
    held assumption that inter-individual differences inhibit consensus. In this talk,
    we depart from this assumption to examine how heterogeneity among agents influences
    stability and convergence in flocking dynamics. We reveal that appropriate choice
    of inter-individual differences can in fact promote consensus, significantly outperforming
    their homogeneous counterparts [2]. Fig. 1a compares the convergence error in
    target tracking for optimized flocks of heterogeneous and homogeneous agents,
    showing that heterogeneous agents converge to a desired formation 36% faster.
    We show how this counterintuitive phenomenon can be leveraged to enhance performance
    in a range of collective tasks, including flock formation, target tracking, and
    obstacle maneuvering. The latter is illustrated in Fig.1b,c, which shows the improvement
    in cohesion and collision avoidance for flocks of heterogeneous agents. Finally,
    we conclude the talk by establishing system disorder as a mechanism to promote
    collective behavior across a wide variety of systems beyond flocking dynamics.

  Talk title: Triadic percolation induces dynamical topological patterns in higher-order
    networks
  Abstract: Triadic interactions are higher-order interactions which occur when a
    set of nodes affects the interaction between two other nodes. Examples of triadic
    interactions are present in the brain when glia modulate the synaptic signals
    among neuron pairs or when interneuron axo-axonic synapses enable presynaptic
    inhibition and facilitation, and in ecosystems when one or more species can affect
    the interaction among two other species. On random graphs, triadic percolation
    has been recently shown to turn percolation into a fully fledged dynamical process
    in which the size of the giant component undergoes a route to chaos. However,
    in many real cases, triadic interactions are local and occur on spatially embedded
    networks. In this work, we show that triadic interactions in spatial networks
    induce a very complex spatio-temporal modulation of the giant component which
    gives rise to triadic percolation patterns with significantly different topology.
    We classify the observed patterns (stripes, octopus, and small clusters) with
    topological data analysis and we assess their information content (entropy and
    complexity). Moreover, we illustrate the multistability of the dynamics of the
    triadic percolation patterns, and we provide a comprehensive phase diagram of
    the model. These results open new perspectives in percolation as they demonstrate
    that in presence of spatial triadic interactions, the giant component can acquire
    a time-varying topology. Hence, this work provides a theoretical framework that
    can be applied to model realistic scenarios in which the giant component is time
    dependent as in neuroscience.

  Talk title: Delocalization of Physical Laplacian Eigenvectors due to Degree-Volume
    Correlation
  Abstract: Physical networks, embedded in three-dimensional space under physical
    constraints, are found in various physical and biological systems, ranging from
    self-assembling systems and meta-materials to biological neural networks and vascular
    networks, to name a few. Recent studies have revealed that the physicality of
    networks results in emergent structural and dynamical features, such as topological
    entanglement, bundling, and correlations between network structure and physical
    layout. Particularly, linear correlations between node degree and node volume
    were shown to arise both in real and model physical networks. In this work, we
    study the effect of linear degree-volume correlations on the dynamics on physical
    networks.  For this, we systematically investigate the so-called physical Laplacian,
    which captures diffusion-like dynamics on nodes with heterogeneous volumes. We
    focus on the roles of the degree-volume correlation strength, noise in volumes,
    and network topology by examining the spectral properties of physical Laplacians.
    Our results show that the emergent volume-degree correlations in physical networks
    can suppress or mitigate the effect of hubs, preventing extreme localizations
    of Fiedler and leading eigenvectors in heterogeneous networks. While our motivation
    arose from physical networks, our results can also apply to network-of-networks
    and multilayer networks in which layer sizes are heterogeneous.

  Talk title: Decomposing nonequilibrium force-fields by reconstructing graphs from
    stochastic trajectories
  Abstract: The stochastic dynamics of real-world processes are often far from equilibrium,
    resulting in time-irreversible trajectoriesand the production of entropy. Nonequilibrium
    dynamics in such processes appears to be crucial to the healthyfunctioning of
    bio-physiological systems, resulting in recent interest in the analysis of nonequilibrium
    flows in realworld data. Stationary Langevin processes admit the Helmholtz-Hodge
    decomposition into reversible and irreversiblecomponents. This decomposition can
    be directly associated with the discrete Hodge decomposition for flows on graphs
    and simplicial complexes. We leverage the relationship between the continuous
    and discrete decomposition to construct a method for analysing nonequilibrium
    stochastic trajectories. Our approach begins with an ensemble of trajectories.
    Considering this to be a point cloud, we perform sub-sampling to obtain a uniform
    representation in space. We tessellate the sampled points with the Delauney triangulation
    to obtain a triangular grid of bins. Using a maximum-likelihood estimator, we
    infer a continuous-time Markov process using the bins as discrete states. From
    this Markov process, we define an edge-flow on the dual tessellation, which we
    thendecompose using the discrete decomposition to reveal the irreversible and
    reversible dynamics, directly from the stochastictrajectories. We apply our approach
    to both solvable and nonlinear systems such as the stochastic linear, limit cycle,
    van der Pol and Rössler systems, where we confirm that our approach captures the
    relative proportion of irreversible flow. Finally, we apply our method to recordings
    from red-blood cells, as well as healthy and arrhythmic heartbeats, showing increased
    prevalence of irreversibility in active vs passive red-blood cells and healthy
    vs arrhythmic heartbeats. Our work represents a powerful new tool for the analysis
    of real-world time-series using topological signal processing, from the perspective
    of nonequilibrium physics.
