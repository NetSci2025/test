  Talk title: Signed graphs in data sciences via communicability geometry
  Abstract: Signed networks, consisting of both positive and negative edges, offer
    a powerful framework for modeling complex systems with antagonistic interactions.
    While this field has gained significant attention recently, key challenges remain,
    such as developing a reliable distance metric for signed edges, identifying factions
    within the network, and predicting alliances or conflicts based on the network's
    structure.In this study, we introduce a novel approach to address these challenges
    using the concept of signed communicability, defined as the exponential of the
    adjacency matrix. Communicability functions have been explored for the case of
    unsigned networks, yet no extension to signed networks had been done before. By
    considering all walks between two nodes, the communicability function measures
    the effective level of alliance or conflict between them. Additionally, it induces
    a metric that fulfills the axioms of an Euclidean distance even in the presence
    of signed edges. Finally, it can be used to get a measure of cosine similarity
    between nodes.These novel metrics are then combined with standard data analysis
    methods in order to gain insights into the structural properties of signed networks.
    Specifically, our framework can induce low-dimensional network embeddings, uncover
    hidden factions, establish alliance hierarchies, and quantify political polarization.
    We show the effectiveness of this framework in a variety of applications, including
    the analysis of political networks, tribal systems, and international relations.
    Overall, our results provide a rigorous mathematical foundation and a set of versatile
    tools for the empirical analysis of signed networks.

  Talk title: Emergence of Shared and Polarized Beliefs from the Dynamics of Networked
    Belief Systems
  Abstract: Beliefs shape how we interact with the world, and cognitive and social
    biases guide these interactions, reinforcing the dynamic interplay between our
    beliefs and environment. Beliefs are interconnected, often forming coherent “belief
    systems” through which we make sense of the world. For example, refusal of childhood
    vaccinations is associated with home births. Although many of such correlations
    between beliefs can be naturally explained by how much they coherently fit together,
    our understanding of nontrivial associations is still in its infancy. For instance,
    why do people who support strong gun rights deny climate change? Why are liberals
    stereotyped as “tax-hiking, government-expanding, latte-drinking, sushi-eating,
    Volvo-driving, New York Times-reading, body-piercing, Hollywood-loving”? In this
    work, we build on a previous belief system dynamics framework, by adding a spontaneous
    internal belief update mechanism and the mechanism where we observe others’ expressed
    beliefs and form our beliefs about them. We show that the addition of this simple
    mechanism is enough to produce the emergence of unrelated yet correlated beliefs
    in a population. We also show that these new beliefs can be polarized or shared
    among subpopulations.

  Talk title: Statistically validated projection of bipartite signed networks
  Abstract: 'Bipartite networks provide a major insight into the organisation of many
    real-world systems, unveiling the mechanisms that drive the interactions occurring
    between distinct groups of nodes. Of particular interest are two-mode networks
    whose edges admit a sign: examples are provided by human interactions with entities
    such as products, where agents either cast a positive or negative vote or abstain
    from voting at all. One of the most relevant issues encountered when modelling
    a bipartite network is that of devising a way to obtain a monopartite projection
    onto the layer of interest that preserves as much as possible the information
    encoded into the original structure. In the present contribution we propose an
    unsupervised algorithm to obtain statistically validated projections of bipartite,
    signed networks, according to which any, two nodes sharing a statistically-significant
    number of concordant (discordant) relationships are connected by a positive (negative)
    edge. More precisely, we propose two variants of it, according to the way ambivalent
    patterns and missing ties are treated. Since assessing the statistical significance
    of any, two nodes similarity requires a proper benchmark, here we consider four,
    different Exponential Random Graphs, with homogeneous as well as heterogeneous
    constraints, either leaving the topology free or keeping the topology fixed. Our
    algorithm outputs a matrix of link-specific p-values, from which a validated projection
    can be obtained upon running a multiple hypothesis testing procedure. After testing
    our method on a synthetic configuration output by a fully controllable generative
    model, we apply it to four, social real-world configurations: in all cases, non-trivial,
    mesoscopic structures, induced by relationships that cannot be traced back to
    the constraints defining the employed benchmarks, are detected.'

  Talk title: Multidimensional attributes make structural balance dynamics measurable
  Abstract: We study a social network where each agent possesses a set of attributes.
    Following the homophily principle, using agents’ attributes, we denote relations
    as positive (friendly) or negative (unfriendly). Distinguishing the signs of relationships
    between pairs of agents can be performed for each attribute separately or considering
    all attributes together in the multidimensional space. Structural balance theory
    (SBT) analyses stability of groups in signed social networks. The theory concerns
    structures of all sizes focusing on triads - connected trios of people. SBT states
    that unbalanced triads are less stable than balanced ones. We apply our signed
    network construction definition to study the NetSense dataset containing relationships
    between university students and students' opinions on important social topics.
    We test for which conditions SBT principles can be measured in the system. To
    this aim, we use static and dynamical structural balance metrics, such as density
    of balanced triads and triad transition probabilities, respectively. We compare
    the measures obtained for the real network with those for three different null
    models and two randomized processes.  Our results show that for the analyzed dataset,
    SBT influence is not observed in the case of signs constructed using separate
    attributes. Triad densities for real networks are not statistically different
    from densities in null models. However, when considering all attributes together,
    for the range of tolerance values, multidimensional triads are significantly more
    balanced in the real network. We also propose an agent-based model with triad
    dynamics causing coevolution of attributes and edge signs. This model reproduces
    transition probabilities better than randomized processes for a similar range
    of tolerance values. Summing up, multidimensional attributes are sufficient to
    measure SBT influence.

  Talk title: Negative Ties Highlight Hidden Extremes in Social Media Polarization
  Abstract: Human interactions in the online world are made of a combination of positive
    and negative exchanges. These diverse interactions can be captured using signed
    network representations, where the edges can take either positive or negative
    weights to indicate friendship or animosity between individuals. In political
    contexts, signed networks offer valuable insights into online social polarization
    by capturing antagonistic interactions and ideological divides. This study analyzes
    polarization on the Menéame platform, a Spanish social media site that facilitates
    engagement with news stories through comments and voting.  Using a dual-method
    approach---Signed Hamiltonian Eigenvector Embedding for Proximity (SHEEP) for
    signed networks and Correspondence Analysis (CA) for unsigned networks---we investigate
    how including negative ties enhances the understanding of structural polarization.  We
    quantify the level of positive and negative structural polarization on the platform
    across different conversation topics. We find that on the Menéame network, negative
    ties are necessary for detecting antagonism, while the unsigned network delineates
    ideological communities. We also show that far-left users on the platform are
    more likely to engage with users across ideological lines, even if through negative
    interactions, whereas far-right users interact primarily with users similar to
    themselves.
