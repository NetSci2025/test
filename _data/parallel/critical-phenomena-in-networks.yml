  Talk title: Complex Contagion on Random Highly Clustered Networks
  Abstract: We study complex contagion on random networks with high clustering. We
    focus on the homogeneous contagion rule, in which a node is infected if at least
    two neighbours become infected. This case is representative of higher order interactions,
    and demonstrates the significant effect of clustering on the contagion. Since
    complex contagion is frequently used to model social adoption, and social networks
    are characterised by high clustering, this is an important consideration.In locally
    treelike networks, this process corresponds to bootstrap percolation. In such
    networks one observes the continuous appearance of a giant component of infected
    nodes, which may then be followed by a second discontinuous hybrid transition
    with a large jump in contagion. However the initial infection required may be
    large. However, when there are triangles present in the network which share an
    edge, the contagion spreads directly between them. Clusters of triangles connected
    in this way thus facilitate the spread of the contagion.We explored this complex
    contagion on random highly clustered networks, generated using the fSTC random
    network model. This model closes triads at random in a backbone network (which
    can be chosen to be locally tree-like). Networks generated in this way contain
    small motifs in similar distributions to real-world networks, and in particular
    contain clusters of edge-adjacent triangles. The use of the fSTC random network
    model allows a theoretical treatment, so we can calculate the size of the contagion,
    the giant component and the critical thresholds using self-consistency equation
    techniques.While the critical phenomena remain qualitatively the same, we find
    the presence of clustering may move the network from a region without a discontinuous
    transition to one where it is present. Most importantly, with significant clustering,
    a large contagion may arise from a significantly smaller initial infection than
    would occur in a comparable non-clustered network.

  Talk title: 'Percolation in networks: beyond nearest neighbors'
  Abstract: Standard percolation theory assumes that two active nodes belong to the
    same cluster if there is a path of adjacent active nodes between them. More general
    definitions are possible, with percolation clusters not necessarily coinciding
    with topologically connected components. In Extended-Range Percolation the path
    between two nodes in the same cluster may contain up to R-1 inactive consecutive
    nodes.A generating function approach allows to solve exactly site percolation
    on random locally treelike networks for small values of R, finding that not only
    the percolation threshold depends on R, but that, on strongly heterogeneous networks,
    also critical exponents are R-dependent. The combinatorial complexity of the approach
    increases rapidly, because two active nodes may be in the same cluster even if
    they are at distance larger than R, due to the presence of other active nodes,
    acting as ``bridges'', located off the shortest path. This makes the approach
    unsuitable for large R.The problem is solved by a message-passing approach which,
    while reproducing the results already found for small values of R, allows for
    a straightforward generalization to any value of R, taming the rapidly increasing
    combinatorial complexity of the previous approach. The same message passing framework
    allows to solve Extended-Range Percolation on more general substrates. The application
    to multilayer networks leads to a rich phenomenology already on homogeneous networks,
    due to the interplay between the extended range, which tends to increaserobustness
    (it reduces the percolation threshold) and interdependence, which tends to decrease
    robustness (it increases the percolation threshold). In particular, if active
    nodes are interdependent but inactive nodes are not, Extended-Range percolation
    in multilayer networks exhibits a phase-diagram characterized by two discontinuous
    hybrid transitions with a reentrant nonpercolating phase.

  Talk title: 'A new look at self-organized criticality in networks: from critical
    points to manifolds'
  Abstract: Self-organized criticality has often been depicted as a one-dimensional
    process where one parameter is tuned to its critical value. This can severely
    restrict the range of possible behaviors that an adaptive system can support.
    However, the number of parameters is vast in most real-world systems such as the
    human brain, where self-organized criticality has been suggested to play a role.
    Therefore, the states of the system corresponding to criticality can be expected
    to form a manifold in a high-dimensional parameter space. Hence, an adaptive system
    may move along this critical manifold and explore its parameter space without
    compromising the benefits of criticality.In our work (PRL 130, 188401), we demonstrated
    for the first time the phenomenon of self-organized critical drift, where simple
    adaptive rules drive a self-organizing system to drift on the critical manifold.
    We illustrated the phenomenon in a neuro-inspired adaptive network, where the
    network topology is shaped by the dynamics taking place on the network. Our results
    show that the criticality hypothesis is more flexible than previously thought
    – a system can remain at criticality while its structure continues to change.After
    this initial discovery, the next step is to explore further the properties of
    these manifolds. As an adaptive network moves along the manifold, it may drift
    to a dynamically different regime, and if the critical manifolds associated with
    different phase transitions intersect, the system may become critical in multiple
    different ways at once. In our current work, we study an adaptive network self-organizing
    to two different phase transitions (Hopf and Turing) and analyze how the system
    properties change as the system drifts along these intersecting manifolds. Overall,
    our work provides a novel perspective on how self-organizing systems move between
    different topological and dynamical regimes while remaining critical, effectively
    resolving many previous challenges in the field.

  Talk title: Anomalous percolation in a dynamical network model for melt ponds on
    sea ice
  Abstract: We examine bond percolation in a dynamic network model for the evolution
    of melt ponds on sea ice, where catchments for ponds are nodes and water fluxes
    between these are edges. Fluxes along edges can change between states of no flow,
    uni-directional flow, or bi-directional flow. Three different types of dynamic
    bond percolation are identified, and, when analysed, all are found to be examples
    of anomalous percolation, with calculated percolation thresholds that deviate
    substantially from those of random percolation. One occurs during initial formation
    of ponds and flooding of the floe. Another occurs during drainage, and a final
    one can occur post drainage as parts of the ice surface are submerged below sea
    level. Anomalous percolation occurs in each because the choices of edge changes
    are not independent. Analysis of how independence is broken helps to develop an
    understanding of the behaviour of the model and of pond systems. We find that
    ponds that overflow into others before joining together help to spread water across
    the floe and delay percolation. We find that percolation during drainage is strongly
    dependent on the network topology, displaying hysteresis and a delayed breakup
    of the network for lower levels of connectivity compared to classical percolation,
    but hastened break-up for an underlying network with higher connectivity. Our
    approach demonstrates how anomalous percolation can be used not just as a descriptor,
    but as an analysis tool, providing insight into the mathematics of processes on
    network models, and into the physics of the systems that these models represent.
