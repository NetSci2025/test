One-page abstracts should include text, one figure with caption and [selected] references. Each submission should be submitted in Adobe's Portable Document Format (PDF) and formatted using the provided abstract template. You can download the LaTeX template <a href="https://github.com/NetSci2025/netsci2025.github.io/raw/main/assets/templates/NetSci2025_abstract_template.zip" download>here</a> or see the a PDF example <a href="https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16743747/NetSci2025_sample_abstract.pdf" download>here</a>.

Accepted abstracts require in-person presentation by one author, who can present a maximum of one accepted abstract in the main conference, and must register by the early-bird registration deadline.

Any questions about abstract submissions can be sent to: [netsci2025abstracts@gmail.com](netsci2025abstracts@gmail.com)


## Call for satellites

**NetSci 2025 will host several Satellite Symposia on June 2 and 3, before the main conference.**  

These satellite events are full-day or half-day meetings with a focus on a specific topic of Network Science and its Applications.  

All network science related subjects are welcome.  

### How to submit a proposal  

We invite the community to submit a proposal for a satellite symposium. The proposal must contain:
* **Title**: descriptive title of the satellite
* **Abstract**: brief summary of the topic and aims of the satellite
* **Contact information**: names, affiliations, and emails of all organizers. Indicate one spokesperson (contact person)
* **Format**: number of speakers, expected number of participants, length/duration (0.5 or 1 day), preliminary program, and number of participants at previous editions if applicable
* **Preliminary list of speakers**: listing confirmed or pre-contacted speakers will be an advantage during the review

Submit a single PDF file (maximum 2 pages) by email to: [netsci2025satellites@gmail.com](mailto:netsci2025satellites@gmail.com)  
Incomplete or longer proposals will be automatically discarded  

**Submission Deadline: 02 December 2024**

Expected notification of acceptance: 16 December 2024



## Important dates

## Call for travel support grants
The NetSci organising committee is pleased to announce a limited number of travel grants to attend the conference. The goal is to support individuals for whom attendance would cause a financial burden, e.g., from low and middle-income countries, that require financial support for travel and conference costs in order to attend. Conference grants will typically be in the form of a reimbursement, up to a given amount, for economy-class flights, accommodation, visa costs, and/or health insurance.
Grants will only be awarded to people with an accepted abstract submission to NetSci. 

Applicants must fill out the form [here](https://forms.gle/sChqKjAf6LoWQwxa8).

The conference will be in-person only.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us: [netsci2025@gmail.com](mailto:netsci2025@gmail.com)



## How to proceed
- Authors must submit their abstracts online through the paper submission system;
- Abstracts must be submitted according to the instructions below to ensure abstracts will be readable through the online review system and adhere to publication policies;
- Abstracts submitted are reviewed by experts selected by the conference committee for their demonstrated knowledge of particular topics. Authors will be notified of the review results by email.

If your paper is accepted, it will be assigned to either a lecture session or a poster session. Prepare your presentation accordingly, following the guidelines below. The author's request for an oral or poster presentation is taken into consideration but the final decision to place a paper in a lecture or poster session rests with the evaluation committee.


### Abstract Requirements

Abstracts may be no longer than 1 page, including all text, figures, and references. Please note that after the submission deadline the list and the order of the authors cannot be modified, and must remain unchanged in the final version of the program.

Each accepted paper must be presented by one of the authorsâ€™ in-person at the conference site according to the schedule published. Presentation by anyone else than one of the co-authors (proxies, video or remote cast) is not allowed unless explicitly approved before the conference by the technical committee. One of the authors must register for the conference and must register before the author registration deadline. Failure to do so will result in automatic withdrawal of the paper from the conference program.

For posters, one author must be present at the poster during the entire duration of the session.

An author cannot present more than 1 accepted paper.

### File Format

The review process will be performed from the electronic submission of your paper. To ensure that your document is compatible with the review system and proceedings system, you must adhere to the following requirements. Papers must be submitted in Adobe's Portable Document Format (PDF). These requirements mandate that your files:

- Must NOT have Adobe Document Protection or Document Security enabled ;
- Must NOT be password-protected ;
- Must be 'US Letter';
- Does not contain hyperlinks;
- Have monochrome images down-sampled at 600 dpi, grayscale & colour images at 300 dpi.

### File Size Limit

Authors will be permitted to submit files weighing up to 5 MB.

### Writing Language

English is the official language of the conference. As a result, all papers must be entirely submitted (and presented) in English.

### Authors List

The authors' name(s) and affiliation(s) appear below the title in capital and lower case letters. NetSci Committee does not perform blind reviews, so be sure to include the author list in your submitted paper. Papers with multiple authors and affiliations may require two or more lines for this information. The order of the authors on the document should exactly match in number and order the authors typed into the online submission form.
