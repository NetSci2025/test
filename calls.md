## NetSci

The International School and Conference on Network Science, NetSci, is the flagship conference on Complex Networks promoted by the Network Science Society. It brings under one umbrella a wide variety of leading researchers, practitioners, and stakeholders with a direct interest in **Network Science**, from Physics to Computer Science, Biology, Social Sciences, Economics, and Technological and Communication Networks, among others. The conference focuses on interdisciplinary research on all aspects of network science and modeling, ranging from foundational works to applications in various disciplines.


The conference will be in-person only.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us: [netsci2025@gmail.com](mailto:netsci2025@gmail.com)



## How to proceed
- Authors must submit their abstracts online through the paper submission system;
- Abstracts must be submitted according to the instructions below to ensure abstracts will be readable through the online review system and adhere to publication policies;
- Abstracts submitted are reviewed by experts selected by the conference committee for their demonstrated knowledge of particular topics. Authors will be notified of the review results by email.

If your paper is accepted, it will be assigned to either a lecture session or a poster session. Prepare your presentation accordingly, following the guidelines below. The author's request for an oral or poster presentation is taken into consideration but the final decision to place a paper in a lecture or poster session rests with the evaluation committee.


### Abstract Requirements

Abstracts may be no longer than 1 page, including all text, figures, and references. Please note that after the submission deadline the list and the order of the authors cannot be modified, and must remain unchanged in the final version of the program.

Each accepted paper must be presented by one of the authorsâ€™ in-person at the conference site according to the schedule published. Presentation by anyone else than one of the co-authors (proxies, video or remote cast) is not allowed unless explicitly approved before the conference by the technical committee. One of the authors must register for the conference and must register before the author registration deadline. Failure to do so will result in automatic withdrawal of the paper from the conference program.

For posters, one author must be present at the poster during the entire duration of the session.

An author cannot present more than 1 accepted paper.

### File Format

The review process will be performed from the electronic submission of your paper. To ensure that your document is compatible with the review system and proceedings system, you must adhere to the following requirements. Papers must be submitted in Adobe's Portable Document Format (PDF). These requirements mandate that your files:

- Must NOT have Adobe Document Protection or Document Security enabled ;
- Must NOT be password-protected ;
- Must be 'US Letter';
- Does not contain hyperlinks;
- Have monochrome images down-sampled at 600 dpi, grayscale & colour images at 300 dpi.

### File Size Limit

Authors will be permitted to submit files weighing up to 5 MB.

### Writing Language

English is the official language of the conference. As a result, all papers must be entirely submitted (and presented) in English.

### Authors List

The authors' name(s) and affiliation(s) appear below the title in capital and lower case letters. NetSci Committee does not perform blind reviews, so be sure to include the author list in your submitted paper. Papers with multiple authors and affiliations may require two or more lines for this information. The order of the authors on the document should exactly match in number and order the authors typed into the online submission form.
